LJ001-0001|Printing, in the only sense with which we are at present concerned, differs from most if not from all the arts and crafts represented in the Exhibition|English
LJ001-0002|in being comparatively modern.|English
LJ001-0003|For although the Chinese took impressions from wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries before the woodcutters of the Netherlands, by a similar process|English
LJ001-0004|produced the block books, which were the immediate predecessors of the true printed book,|English
LJ001-0005|the invention of movable metal letters in the middle of the fifteenth century may justly be considered as the invention of the art of printing.|English
LJ001-0006|And it is worth mention in passing that, as an example of fine typography,|English
LJ001-0007|"the earliest book printed with movable types, the Gutenberg, or ""forty-two line Bible"" of about fourteen fifty-five,"|English
LJ001-0008|has never been surpassed.|English
LJ001-0009|Printing, then, for our purpose, may be considered as the art of making books by means of movable types.|English
LJ001-0010|Now, as all books not primarily intended as picture-books consist principally of types composed to form letterpress,|English
LJ001-0011|it is of the first importance that the letter used should be fine in form;|English
LJ001-0012|especially as no more time is occupied, or cost incurred, in casting, setting, or printing beautiful letters|English
LJ001-0013|than in the same operations with ugly ones.|English
LJ001-0014|And it was a matter of course that in the Middle Ages, when the craftsmen took care that beautiful form should always be a part of their productions whatever they were,|English
LJ001-0015|the forms of printed letters should be beautiful, and that their arrangement on the page should be reasonable and a help to the shapeliness of the letters themselves.|English
LJ001-0016|The Middle Ages brought calligraphy to perfection, and it was natural therefore|English
LJ001-0017|that the forms of printed letters should follow more or less closely those of the written character, and they followed them very closely.|English
LJ001-0018|The first books were printed in black letter, i.e. the letter which was a Gothic development of the ancient Roman character,|English
LJ001-0019|"and which developed more completely and satisfactorily on the side of the ""lower-case"" than the capital letters;"|English
LJ001-0020|"the ""lower-case"" being in fact invented in the early Middle Ages."|English
LJ001-0021|The earliest book printed with movable type, the aforesaid Gutenberg Bible, is printed in letters which are an exact imitation|English
LJ001-0022|"of the more formal ecclesiastical writing which obtained at that time; this has since been called ""missal type,"""|English
LJ001-0023|and was in fact the kind of letter used in the many splendid missals, psalters, etc., produced by printing in the fifteenth century.|English
LJ001-0024|But the first Bible actually dated (which also was printed at Maintz by Peter Schoeffer in the year fourteen sixty-two)|English
LJ001-0025|imitates a much freer hand, simpler, rounder, and less spiky, and therefore far pleasanter and easier to read.|English
LJ001-0026|On the whole the type of this book may be considered the ne-plus-ultra of Gothic type,|English
LJ001-0027|especially as regards the lower-case letters; and type very similar was used during the next fifteen or twenty years not only by Schoeffer,|English
LJ001-0028|but by printers in Strasburg, Basle, Paris, Lubeck, and other cities.|English
LJ001-0029|But though on the whole, except in Italy, Gothic letter was most often used|English
LJ001-0030|a very few years saw the birth of Roman character not only in Italy, but in Germany and France.|English
LJ001-0031|In fourteen sixty-five Sweynheim and Pannartz began printing in the monastery of Subiaco near Rome,|English
LJ001-0032|and used an exceedingly beautiful type, which is indeed to look at a transition between Gothic and Roman,|English
LJ001-0033|but which must certainly have come from the study of the twelfth or even the eleventh century MSS.|English
LJ001-0034|They printed very few books in this type, three only; but in their very first books in Rome, beginning with the year fourteen sixty-eight,|English
LJ001-0035|they discarded this for a more completely Roman and far less beautiful letter.|English
LJ001-0036|But about the same year Mentelin at Strasburg began to print in a type which is distinctly Roman;|English
LJ001-0037|and the next year Gunther Zeiner at Augsburg followed suit;|English
LJ001-0038|while in fourteen seventy at Paris Udalric Gering and his associates turned out the first books printed in France, also in Roman character.|English
LJ001-0039|The Roman type of all these printers is similar in character,|English
LJ001-0040|and is very simple and legible, and unaffectedly designed for use; but it is by no means without beauty.|English
LJ001-0041|It must be said that it is in no way like the transition type of Subiaco,|English
LJ001-0042|and though more Roman than that, yet scarcely more like the complete Roman type of the earliest printers of Rome.|English
LJ001-0043|A further development of the Roman letter took place at Venice.|English
LJ001-0044|John of Spires and his brother Vindelin, followed by Nicholas Jenson, began to print in that city,|English
LJ001-0045|fourteen sixty-nine, fourteen seventy;|English
LJ001-0046|their type is on the lines of the German and French rather than of the Roman printers.|English
LJ001-0047|Of Jenson it must be said that he carried the development of Roman type as far as it can go:|English
LJ001-0048|his letter is admirably clear and regular, but at least as beautiful as any other Roman type.|English
LJ001-0049|"After his death in the ""fourteen eighties,"" or at least by fourteen ninety, printing in Venice had declined very much;"|English
LJ001-0050|and though the famous family of Aldus restored its technical excellence, rejecting battered letters,|English
LJ001-0051|"and paying great attention to the ""press work"" or actual process of printing,"|English
LJ001-0052|yet their type is artistically on a much lower level than Jenson's, and in fact|English
LJ001-0053|they must be considered to have ended the age of fine printing in Italy.|English
LJ001-0054|Jenson, however, had many contemporaries who used beautiful type,|English
LJ001-0055|some of which -- as, e.g., that of Jacobus Rubeus or Jacques le Rouge -- is scarcely distinguishable from his.|English
LJ001-0056|It was these great Venetian printers, together with their brethren of Rome, Milan,|English
LJ001-0057|Parma, and one or two other cities, who produced the splendid editions of the Classics, which are one of the great glories of the printer's art,|English
LJ001-0058|and are worthy representatives of the eager enthusiasm for the revived learning of that epoch. By far,|English
LJ001-0059|the greater part of these Italian printers, it should be mentioned, were Germans or Frenchmen, working under the influence of Italian opinion and aims.|English
LJ001-0060|It must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries|English
LJ001-0061|the Roman letter was used side by side with the Gothic.|English
LJ001-0062|Even in Italy most of the theological and law books were printed in Gothic letter,|English
LJ001-0063|which was generally more formally Gothic than the printing of the German workmen,|English
LJ001-0064|many of whose types, indeed, like that of the Subiaco works, are of a transitional character.|English
LJ001-0065|This was notably the case with the early works printed at Ulm, and in a somewhat lesser degree at Augsburg.|English
LJ001-0066|In fact Gunther Zeiner's first type (afterwards used by Schussler) is remarkably like the type of the before-mentioned Subiaco books.|English
LJ001-0067|In the Low Countries and Cologne, which were very fertile of printed books, Gothic was the favorite.|English
LJ001-0068|The characteristic Dutch type, as represented by the excellent printer Gerard Leew, is very pronounced and uncompromising Gothic.|English
LJ001-0069|This type was introduced into England by Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's successor,|English
LJ001-0070|and was used there with very little variation all through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and indeed into the eighteenth.|English
LJ001-0071|Most of Caxton's own types are of an earlier character, though they also much resemble Flemish or Cologne letter.|English
LJ001-0072|After the end of the fifteenth century the degradation of printing, especially in Germany and Italy,|English
LJ001-0073|went on apace; and by the end of the sixteenth century there was no really beautiful printing done:|English
LJ001-0074|the best, mostly French or Low-Country, was neat and clear, but without any distinction;|English
LJ001-0075|the worst, which perhaps was the English, was a terrible falling-off from the work of the earlier presses;|English
LJ001-0076|and things got worse and worse through the whole of the seventeenth century, so that in the eighteenth printing was very miserably performed.|English
LJ001-0077|In England about this time, an attempt was made (notably by Caslon, who started business in London as a type-founder in seventeen twenty)|English
LJ001-0078|to improve the letter in form.|English
LJ001-0079|Caslon's type is clear and neat, and fairly well designed;|English
LJ001-0080|he seems to have taken the letter of the Elzevirs of the seventeenth century for his model:|English
LJ001-0081|type cast from his matrices is still in everyday use.|English
LJ001-0082|In spite, however, of his praiseworthy efforts, printing had still one last degradation to undergo.|English
LJ001-0083|The seventeenth century founts were bad rather negatively than positively.|English
LJ001-0084|But for the beauty of the earlier work they might have seemed tolerable.|English
LJ001-0085|It was reserved for the founders of the later eighteenth century to produce letters which are positively ugly, and which, it may be added,|English
LJ001-0086|are dazzling and unpleasant to the eye owing to the clumsy thickening and vulgar thinning of the lines:|English
LJ001-0087|for the seventeenth-century letters are at least pure and simple in line. The Italian, Bodoni, and the Frenchman, Didot,|English
LJ001-0088|were the leaders in this luckless change, though our own Baskerville, who was at work some years before them, went much on the same lines;|English
LJ001-0089|but his letters, though uninteresting and poor, are not nearly so gross and vulgar as those of either the Italian or the Frenchman.|English
LJ001-0090|With this change the art of printing touched bottom,|English
LJ001-0091|so far as fine printing is concerned, though paper did not get to its worst till about eighteen forty.|English
LJ001-0092|The Chiswick press in eighteen forty-four revived Caslon's founts, printing for Messrs. Longman the Diary of Lady Willoughby.|English
LJ001-0093|This experiment was so far successful that about eighteen fifty Messrs. Miller and Richard of Edinburgh|English
LJ001-0094|"were induced to cut punches for a series of ""old style"" letters."|English
LJ001-0095|These and similar founts, cast by the above firm and others,|English
LJ001-0096|"have now come into general use and are obviously a great improvement on the ordinary ""modern style"" in use in England, which is in fact the Bodoni type"|English
LJ001-0097|"a little reduced in ugliness. The design of the letters of this modern ""old style"" leaves a good deal to be desired,"|English
LJ001-0098|and the whole effect is a little too gray, owing to the thinness of the letters.|English
LJ001-0099|It must be remembered, however, that most modern printing is done by machinery on soft paper, and not by the hand press,|English
LJ001-0100|and these somewhat wiry letters are suitable for the machine process, which would not do justice to letters of more generous design.|English
LJ001-0101|It is discouraging to note that the improvement of the last fifty years is almost wholly confined to Great Britain.|English
LJ001-0102|Here and there a book is printed in France or Germany with some pretension to good taste,|English
LJ001-0103|but the general revival of the old forms has made no way in those countries.|English
LJ001-0104|Italy is contentedly stagnant.|English
LJ001-0105|America has produced a good many showy books, the typography, paper, and illustrations of which are, however, all wrong,|English
LJ001-0106|oddity rather than rational beauty and meaning being apparently the thing sought for both in the letters and the illustrations.|English
LJ001-0107|To say a few words on the principles of design in typography:|English
LJ001-0108|it is obvious that legibility is the first thing to be aimed at in the forms of the letters;|English
LJ001-0109|this is best furthered by the avoidance of irrational swellings and spiky projections, and by the using of careful purity of line.|English
LJ001-0110|Even the Caslon type when enlarged shows great shortcomings in this respect:|English
LJ001-0111|the ends of many of the letters such as the t and e are hooked up in a vulgar and meaningless way,|English
LJ001-0112|instead of ending in the sharp and clear stroke of Jenson's letters;|English
LJ001-0113|there is a grossness in the upper finishings of letters like the c, the a, and so on,|English
LJ001-0114|an ugly pear-shaped swelling defacing the form of the letter:|English
LJ001-0115|in short, it happens to this craft, as to others, that the utilitarian practice, though it professes to avoid ornament,|English
LJ001-0116|still clings to a foolish, because misunderstood conventionality, deduced from what was once ornament, and is by no means useful;|English
LJ001-0117|which title can only be claimed by artistic practice, whether the art in it be conscious or unconscious.|English
LJ001-0118|In no characters is the contrast between the ugly and vulgar illegibility of the modern type|English
LJ001-0119|and the elegance and legibility of the ancient more striking than in the Arabic numerals.|English
LJ001-0120|In the old print each figure has its definite individuality, and one cannot be mistaken for the other;|English
LJ001-0121|in reading the modern figures the eyes must be strained before the reader can have any reasonable assurance|English
LJ001-0122|that he has a five, an eight, or a three before him, unless the press work is of the best:|English
LJ001-0123|this is awkward if you have to read Bradshaw's Guide in a hurry.|English
LJ001-0124|One of the differences between the fine type and the utilitarian must probably be put down to a misapprehension of a commercial necessity:|English
LJ001-0125|this is the narrowing of the modern letters.|English
LJ001-0126|Most of Jenson's letters are designed within a square,|English
LJ001-0127|the modern letters are narrowed by a third or thereabout; but while this gain of space very much hampers the possibility of beauty of design,|English
LJ001-0128|it is not a real gain, for the modern printer throws the gain away by putting inordinately wide spaces between his lines, which, probably,|English
LJ001-0129|the lateral compression of his letters renders necessary.|English
LJ001-0130|Commercialism again compels the use of type too small in size to be comfortable reading:|English
LJ001-0131|"the size known as ""Long primer"" ought to be the smallest size used in a book meant to be read."|English
LJ001-0132|"Here, again, if the practice of ""leading"" were retrenched larger type could be used without enhancing the price of a book."|English
LJ001-0133|"One very important matter in ""setting up"" for fine printing is the ""spacing,"" that is, the lateral distance of words from one another."|English
LJ001-0134|In good printing the spaces between the words should be as near as possible equal|English
LJ001-0135|it is impossible that they should be quite equal except in lines of poetry|English
LJ001-0136|modern printers understand this, but it is only practiced in the very best establishments.|English
LJ001-0137|But another point which they should attend to they almost always disregard;|English
LJ001-0138|"this is the tendency to the formation of ugly meandering white lines or ""rivers"" in the page"|English
LJ001-0139|a blemish which can be nearly, though not wholly, avoided by care and forethought|English
LJ001-0140|"the desirable thing being ""the breaking of the line"" as in bonding masonry or brickwork"|English
LJ001-0141|The general solidity of a page is much to be sought for|English
LJ001-0142|"modern printers generally overdo the ""whites"" in the spacing, a defect probably forced on them by the characterless quality of the letters."|English
LJ001-0143|For where these are boldly and carefully designed, and each letter is thoroughly individual in form,|English
LJ001-0144|the words may be set much closer together, without loss of clearness.|English
LJ001-0145|"No definite rules, however, except the avoidance of ""rivers"" and excess of white, can be given for the spacing,"|English
LJ001-0146|which requires the constant exercise of judgment and taste on the part of the printer.|English
LJ001-0147|The position of the page on the paper should be considered if the book is to have a satisfactory look.|English
LJ001-0148|Here once more the almost invariable modern practice is in opposition to a natural sense of proportion.|English
LJ001-0149|From the time when books first took their present shape till the end of the sixteenth century, or indeed later,|English
LJ001-0150|the page so lay on the paper that there was more space allowed to the bottom and fore margin than to the top and back of the paper,|English
LJ001-0151|the unit of the book being looked on as the two pages forming an opening.|English
LJ001-0152|The modern printer, in the teeth of the evidence given by his own eyes, considers the single page as the unit, and prints the page in the middle of his paper|English
LJ001-0153|only nominally so, however, in many cases, since when he uses a headline he counts that in,|English
LJ001-0154|the result as measured by the eye being that the lower margin is less than the top one, and that the whole opening has an upside-down look vertically|English
LJ001-0155|and that laterally the page looks as if it were being driven off the paper.|English
LJ001-0156|The paper on which the printing is to be done is a necessary part of our subject:|English
LJ001-0157|of this it may be said that though there is some good paper made now,|English
LJ001-0158|it is never used except for very expensive books, although it would not materially increase the cost in all but the very cheapest.|English
LJ001-0159|The paper that is used for ordinary books is exceedingly bad even in this country, but is beaten in the race for vileness|English
LJ001-0160|by that made in America, which is the worst conceivable.|English
LJ001-0161|There seems to be no reason why ordinary paper should not be better made,|English
LJ001-0162|even allowing the necessity for a very low price; but any improvement must be based on showing openly that the cheap article is cheap,|English
LJ001-0163|e.g. the cheap paper should not sacrifice toughness and durability to a smooth and white surface,|English
LJ001-0164|which should be indications of a delicacy of material and manufacture which would of necessity increase its cost.|English
LJ001-0165|One fruitful source of badness in paper|English
LJ001-0166|is the habit that publishers have of eking out a thin volume by printing it on thick paper almost of the substance of cardboard,|English
LJ001-0167|a device which deceives nobody, and makes a book very unpleasant to read.|English
LJ001-0168|On the whole, a small book should be printed on paper which is as thin as may be without being transparent.|English
LJ001-0169|The paper used for printing the small highly ornamented French service-books about the beginning of the sixteenth century is a model in this respect,|English
LJ001-0170|being thin, tough, and opaque.|English
LJ001-0171|However, the fact must not be blinked that machine-made paper cannot in the nature of things be made of so good a texture as that made by hand.|English
LJ001-0172|The ornamentation of printed books is too wide a subject to be dealt with fully here; but one thing must be said on it.|English
LJ001-0173|The essential point to be remembered is that the ornament, whatever it is, whether picture or pattern-work, should form part of the page,|English
LJ001-0174|should be a part of the whole scheme of the book.|English
LJ001-0175|Simple as this proposition is, it is necessary to be stated,|English
LJ001-0176|because the modern practice is to disregard the relation between the printing and the ornament altogether,|English
LJ001-0177|so that if the two are helpful to one another it is a mere matter of accident.|English
LJ001-0178|The due relation of letter to pictures and other ornament was thoroughly understood by the old printers; so that|English
LJ001-0179|even when the woodcuts are very rude indeed,|English
LJ001-0180|the proportions of the page still give pleasure by the sense of richness that the cuts and letter together convey.|English
LJ001-0181|When, as is most often the case, there is actual beauty in the cuts,|English
LJ001-0182|the books so ornamented are amongst the most delightful works of art that have ever been produced.|English
LJ001-0183|Therefore, granted well-designed type, due spacing of the lines and words, and proper position of the page on the paper,|English
LJ001-0184|all books might be at least comely and well-looking: and if to these good qualities were added really beautiful ornament and pictures,|English
LJ001-0185|printed books might once again illustrate to the full|English
LJ001-0186|the position of our Society that a work of utility might be also a work of art, if we cared to make it so.|English
LJ002-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section four: Newgate down to eighteen eighteen.|English
LJ002-0002|Under the conditions referred to in the previous chapter,|English
LJ002-0003|with criminals and misdemeanants of all shades crowding perpetually into its narrow limits, the latter state of Newgate was worse than the first.|English
LJ002-0004|The new jail fell as far short of the demands made on it as did the old.|English
LJ002-0005|The prison population fluctuated a great deal,|English
LJ002-0006|but it was almost always in excess of the accommodation available, and there were times when the place was full to overflowing.|English
LJ002-0007|Neild gives some figures which well illustrate this.|English
LJ002-0008|On the fourteenth June, eighteen hundred, there were one hundred ninety-nine debtors and two hundred eighty-nine felons in the prison.|English
LJ002-0009|On the twenty-seventh April, in the following year,|English
LJ002-0010|these numbers had risen to two hundred seventy-five and three hundred seventy-five respectively, or six hundred fifty in all.|English
LJ002-0011|For two more years these high figures were steadily maintained, and in eighteen oh three the total rose to seven hundred ten.|English
LJ002-0012|After that they fell as steadily,|English
LJ002-0013|till, eighteen oh eight, the lowest point was touched of one hundred ninety-seven debtors and one hundred eighty-two felons, or three hundred seventy-nine in all.|English
LJ002-0014|The numbers soon increased, however, and by eighteen eleven had again risen to six hundred twenty-nine; and Mr. Neild was told that there had been at one time|English
LJ002-0015|three hundred debtors and nine hundred criminals in Newgate, or twelve hundred prisoners in all.|English
LJ002-0016|Previous to that date there had been seven hundred or eight hundred frequently, and once, in Mr. Akerman's time, one thousand.|English
LJ002-0017|Trustworthy evidence is forthcoming to the effect that these high figures were constantly maintained for many months at a time.|English
LJ002-0018|The inadequacy of the jail was noticed and reported upon again and again by the grand juries of the city of London,|English
LJ002-0019|who seldom let a session go by without visiting Newgate.|English
LJ002-0020|In eighteen thirteen|English
LJ002-0021|the grand jury made a special presentment to the Court of Common Council, pointing out that on the debtors' side, which was intended for only one hundred,|English
LJ002-0022|no less than three hundred forty were crowded, to the great inconvenience and danger of the inmates.|English
LJ002-0023|On the female side matters were much worse;|English
LJ002-0024|Quote. the apartments set apart for them, being built to accommodate sixty persons, now contain about one hundred twenty. End quote.|English
LJ002-0025|Returns laid before the House of Commons showed that six thousand, four hundred thirty-nine persons had been committed to Newgate|English
LJ002-0026|in the three years between eighteen thirteen and eighteen sixteen,|English
LJ002-0027|and this number did not include the debtors, a numerous class, who were still committed to Newgate pending the completion of the White Cross Street prison.|English
LJ002-0028|In order to realize the evils entailed by incarceration in Newgate in these days, it is necessary to give some account of its interior|English
LJ002-0029|as it was occupied and appropriated in eighteen ten.|English
LJ002-0030|"Full details of the arrangements are to be found in Mr. Neild's ""State of Prisons in England, Scotland, and Wales,"" published in eighteen twelve."|English
LJ002-0031|The jail at that date was divided into eight separate and more or less distinct departments, each of which had its own wards and yard.|English
LJ002-0032|These were: one. The male debtors' side.|English
LJ002-0033|two. The female debtors' side. three. The chapel yard. four. The middle yard.|English
LJ002-0034|five. The master felons' side. six. The female felons' side. seven. The state side.|English
LJ002-0035|eight. The press yard.|English
LJ002-0036|one. The male debtors' side consisted of a yard forty-nine feet by thirty-one,|English
LJ002-0037|leading to thirteen wards on various floors, and a day room.|English
LJ002-0038|"Of these wards, three were appropriated to the ""cabin side,"" so called because"|English
LJ002-0039|"they each contained four small rooms or ""cabins"" seven feet square,"|English
LJ002-0040|intended to accommodate a couple of prisoners apiece, but often much more crowded.|English
LJ002-0041|Two other wards were appropriated to the master's side debtors; they were each twenty-three feet by fourteen and a half,|English
LJ002-0042|and supposed to accommodate twenty persons. The eight remaining wards were for the common side debtors,|English
LJ002-0043|long narrow rooms -- one thirty-six feet, six twenty-three feet, and the eighth eighteen,|English
LJ002-0044|the whole about fifteen feet wide.|English
LJ002-0045|The various wards were all about eleven feet in height,|English
LJ002-0046|and were occupied as a rule by ten to fifteen people when the prison was not crowded, but double the number was occasionally placed in them.|English
LJ002-0047|The day room was fitted with benches and settles after the manner of the tap in a public-house.|English
LJ002-0048|two. The female debtors' side consisted of a court-yard forty-nine by sixteen feet,|English
LJ002-0049|leading to two wards, one of which was thirty-six feet by fifteen,|English
LJ002-0050|and the other eighteen by fifteen; and they nominally held twenty-two persons.|English
LJ002-0051|A high wall fifteen feet in height divided the females' court-yard from the men's.|English
LJ002-0052|three. The chapel yard was about forty-three feet by twenty-five.|English
LJ002-0053|It had been for some time devoted principally to felons of the worst types,|English
LJ002-0054|those who were the oldest offenders, sentenced to transportation, and who had narrowly escaped the penalty of death.|English
LJ002-0055|This arrangement was, however, modified after eighteen eleven, and the chapel yard was allotted to misdemeanants and prisoners awaiting trial.|English
LJ002-0056|The wards in this part were five in number, all in dimensions twenty feet by fifteen, with a sixth ward fifteen feet square.|English
LJ002-0057|These wards were all fitted with barrack-beds, but no bedding was supplied.|English
LJ002-0058|The chapel yard led to the chapel, and on the staircase were two rooms frequently set apart for the king's witnesses,|English
LJ002-0059|those who had turned king's evidence, whose safety might have been imperiled had they been lodged with the men against whom they had informed.|English
LJ002-0060|But these king's witnesses were also put at times into the press yard among the capital convicts, seemingly a very dangerous proceeding,|English
LJ002-0061|or they lodged with the gatesmen, the prisoner officers who had charge of the inner gates.|English
LJ002-0062|The middle yard was at first given up to the least heinous offenders. After eighteen twelve it changed functions with the chapel yard.|English
LJ002-0063|It was fifty feet by twenty-five, and had five wards each thirty-eight by fifteen. At one end of the yard was an arcade,|English
LJ002-0064|directly under the chapel, in which there were three cells, used either for the confinement of disorderly and refractory prisoners,|English
LJ002-0065|or female convicts ordered for execution.|English
LJ002-0066|The master felons' side consisted of a yard the same size as the preceding, appropriated nominally to the most decent and better-behaved prisoners,|English
LJ002-0067|but really kept for the few who had funds sufficient to gain them admission to these more comfortable quarters.|English
LJ002-0068|Here were also lodged the gatesmen, the prisoners who had charge of the inner gates, and who were entrusted with the duty of escorting visitors from the gates|English
LJ002-0069|to the various wards their friends occupied.|English
LJ002-0070|The state side was the part stolen from the female felons' side.|English
LJ002-0071|It was large and comparatively commodious, being maintained on a better footing than any other part of the prison.|English
LJ002-0072|The inmates were privileged, either by antecedents or the fortunate possession of sufficient funds to pay the charges of the place.|English
LJ002-0073|Neild takes it for granted that the former rather than the latter prevailed in the selection,|English
LJ002-0074|and tells us that in the state side, quote, such prisoners were safely associated whose manners and conduct evince a more liberal style of education,|English
LJ002-0075|and who are therefore lodged apart from all other districts of the jail. End quote.|English
LJ002-0076|The state side contained twelve good-sized rooms,|English
LJ002-0077|from twenty-one by eighteen feet to fifteen feet square, which were furnished with bedsteads and bedding.|English
LJ002-0078|seven. The press yard was that part set aside for the condemned.|English
LJ002-0079|Its name and its situation were the same as those of the old place of carrying out the terrible sentence inflicted on accused persons who stood mute.|English
LJ002-0080|The long narrow yard still remained as we saw it in Jacobite times,|English
LJ002-0081|and beyond it was now a day room for the capital convicts or those awaiting execution.|English
LJ002-0082|Beyond the press yard were three stories, condemned cells, fifteen in all, with vaulted ceilings nine feet high to the crown of the arch.|English
LJ002-0083|The ground floor cells were nine feet by six;|English
LJ002-0084|those on the first floor were rather larger on account of a set-off in the wall; and the uppermost were the largest, for the same reason.|English
LJ002-0085|Security was provided for in these condemned cells by lining the substantial stone walls with planks studded with broad-headed nails;|English
LJ002-0086|they were lighted by a double-grated window two feet nine inches by fourteen inches; and in the doors, which were four inches thick,|English
LJ002-0087|a circular aperture had been let in to give ventilation and secure a free current of air.|English
LJ002-0088|In each cell there was a barrack bedstead on the floor without bedding.|English
LJ002-0089|eight. The female felons were deprived of part of the space which the architect had intended for them.|English
LJ002-0090|More than half their quadrangle had been partitioned off for another purpose,|English
LJ002-0091|and what remained was divided into a master's and a common side for female felons.|English
LJ002-0092|The two yards were adjoining, that for the common side much the largest.|English
LJ002-0093|There were nine wards in all on the female side, one of them in the attic,|English
LJ002-0094|with four casements and two fireplaces, being allotted for a female infirmary|English
LJ002-0095|and the rest being provided with barrack beds, and in dimensions varying from thirty feet by fifteen to fifteen feet by ten.|English
LJ002-0096|The eight courts above enumerated were well supplied with water;|English
LJ002-0097|"they had dust-bins, sewers, and so forth, ""properly disposed,"" and the city scavenger paid periodical visits to the prison."|English
LJ002-0098|The prisoners had few comforts, beyond the occasional use of a bath at some distance, situated in the press yard,|English
LJ002-0099|to which access was granted rarely and as a great favor. But they were allowed the luxury of drink -- if they could pay for it.|English
LJ002-0100|A recent reform had closed the tap kept by the jailer within the precincts, but|English
LJ002-0101|"there was still a ""convenient room"" which served, and, quote,"|English
LJ002-0102|near it a grating through which the debtors receive their beer from the neighboring public-houses.|English
LJ002-0103|The felons' side has a similar accommodation, and this mode of introducing the beverage is adopted because no publican as such|English
LJ002-0104|can be permitted to enter the interior of this prison. End quote. The tap-room and bar were just behind the felons' entrance lodge,|English
LJ002-0105|"and beyond it was a room called the ""wine room,"" because formerly used for the sale of wine, but"|English
LJ002-0106|in which latterly a copper had been fixed for the cooking of provisions sent in by charitable persons.|English
LJ002-0107|Quote, On the top of the jail, continues Neild, are a watch-house and a sentry-box, where two or more guards, with dogs and firearms,|English
LJ002-0108|watch all night. Adjoining the felons' side lodge is the keeper's office, where the prison books are kept, and his clerk,|English
LJ002-0109|called the clerk of the papers, attends daily. End quote.|English
LJ002-0110|Having thus briefly described the plan and appropriation of the prison, I propose to deal now with the general condition of the inmates, and the manner of their life.|English
LJ002-0111|Of these the debtors, male and female, formed a large proportion.|English
LJ002-0112|The frequency and extent of processes against debtors seventy or eighty years ago will appear almost incredible|English
LJ002-0113|in an age when insolvent acts and bankruptcy courts do so much to relieve the impecunious,|English
LJ002-0114|and imprisonment for debt has almost entirely disappeared.|English
LJ002-0116|The number of processes against debtors annually was extraordinary.|English
LJ002-0117|Neild gives, on the authority of Mr. Burchell, the under sheriff of Middlesex,|English
LJ002-0118|a table showing the figures for the year ending Michaelmas eighteen oh two.|English
LJ002-0119|In that period upwards of two hundred thousand writs|English
LJ002-0120|had been issued for the arrests of debtors in the kingdom, for sums varying from fourpence to five hundred pounds and upwards.|English
LJ002-0121|Fifteen thousand of these were issued in Middlesex alone, which at that time was reckoned as only a fifteenth of Great Britain.|English
LJ002-0122|The number of arrests actually made was one hundred fourteen thousand, three hundred for the kingdom, and seven thousand twenty for Middlesex.|English
LJ002-0123|Barely half of these gave bail bonds on arrests, and the remainder went to prison.|English
LJ002-0124|Quite half of the foregoing writs and arrests applied to sums under thirty pounds.|English
LJ002-0125|Neild also says that in seventeen ninety-three,|English
LJ002-0126|five thousand, seven hundred nineteen writs and executions for debts between ten pounds and twenty pounds were issued in Middlesex,|English
LJ002-0127|and the aggregate amount of debts sued for was eighty-one thousand, seven hundred ninety-one pounds.|English
LJ002-0128|He also makes the curious calculation that the costs of these actions if undefended|English
LJ002-0129|would have amounted to sixty-eight thousand, seven hundred twenty-eight pounds, and if defended,|English
LJ002-0130|two hundred eighty-five thousand, nine hundred fifty pounds; in other words, that to recover eighty odd thousand pounds,|English
LJ002-0131|three times the amount would be expended.|English
LJ002-0132|An elaborate machinery planned for the protection of the trader, and altogether on his side, had long existed for the recovery of debts.|English
LJ002-0133|Alfred the Great established the Court Baron, the Hundred Court, and the County Court, which among other matters entertained pleas for debt.|English
LJ002-0134|The County Court was the sheriff's, who sat there surrounded by the bishop and the magnates of the county;|English
LJ002-0135|but as time passed, difficulties and delays in obtaining judgment led to the removal of causes to the great Court of King's Bench,|English
LJ002-0136|and the disuse of the inferior courts.|English
LJ002-0137|So much inconvenience ensued, that in fifteen eighteen the Corporation obtained from Parliament an act empowering two aldermen|English
LJ002-0138|and four common councilmen to hold Courts of Requests, or Courts of Conscience, to hear and determine all causes of debt|English
LJ002-0139|under forty shillings arising within the city.|English
LJ002-0140|These courts were extended two centuries later to several large provincial towns, and all were in full activity when Neild wrote,|English
LJ002-0141|and indeed supplied the bulk of the poor debtors committed to prison.|English
LJ002-0142|These courts were open to many and grave objections.|English
LJ002-0143|The commissioners who presided were, quote, little otherwise than self-elected|English
LJ002-0144|and when once appointed continued to serve sine die; they were generally near in rank to the parties whose causes they decided.|English
LJ002-0145|Often a commissioner had to leave the bench because he was himself a party to the suit that was sub judice.|English
LJ002-0146|The activity as well as the futility of these courts may be estimated from the statement given by Neild|English
LJ002-0147|that thirteen hundred and twelve debtors were committed by them to Newgate between seventeen ninety-seven and eighteen oh eight,|English
LJ002-0148|and that no more than one hundred ninety-seven creditors recovered debts and costs.|English
LJ002-0149|The latter indeed hung like millstones round the neck of the unhappy insolvent wretches who found themselves in limbo.|English
LJ002-0150|Costs were the gallons of sack to the pennyworth of debt.|English
LJ002-0151|Neild found at his visit to Newgate in eighteen ten,|English
LJ002-0152|fourteen men and women who had lain there ten, eleven, and thirteen years for debts of a few shillings,|English
LJ002-0153|weighted by treble the amount of costs.|English
LJ002-0154|Thus, amongst others, Thomas Blackburn had been committed on October fifteenth for a debt of one shilling five pence.|English
LJ002-0155|for which the costs were six shillings ten pence.|English
LJ002-0156|Thomas Dobson, on twenty-second August, seventeen ninety-nine, for one shilling, with costs of eight shillings, ten pence.|English
LJ002-0157|and Susannah Evans, in October the same year, for two shillings, with costs of six shillings, eight pence.|English
LJ002-0158|Other cases are recorded elsewhere, as at the Giltspur Street Compter, where in eighteen oh five Mr. Neild found a man named William Grant|English
LJ002-0159|detained for one shilling nine pence, with costs of five shillings.|English
LJ002-0160|and John Lancaster for one shilling, eight pence, with costs of seven shillings, six pence. Quote.|English
LJ002-0161|"These surely, I thought,"" says Mr. Neild, ""were bad enough! But it was not so. End quote."|English
LJ002-0162|He recites another most outrageous and extraordinary case, in which one John Bird,|English
LJ002-0163|a market porter, was arrested and committed at the suit of a publican|English
LJ002-0164|for the paltry sum of four pence, with costs of seven shillings, six pence.|English
LJ002-0165|Bird was, however, discharged within three days by a subscription raised among his fellow-prisoners.|English
LJ002-0166|"Mr. Buxton, in his ""Inquiry into the System of Prison Discipline,"""|English
LJ002-0167|quotes a case which came within his own knowledge of a boy sent to prison for non-payment of one penny.|English
LJ002-0168|The lad in question was found in Coldbath Fields prison, to which he had been sent for a month in default of paying a fine of forty shillings.|English
LJ002-0169|He had been in the employ of a corn-chandler at Islington, and went into London with his master's cart and horse.|English
LJ002-0170|There was in the City Road a temporary bar, with a collector of tolls who was sometimes on the spot and sometimes not.|English
LJ002-0171|The boy declared he saw no one, and accordingly passed through without paying the toll of a penny.|English
LJ002-0172|For this he was summoned before a magistrate, and sentenced as already stated.|English
LJ002-0173|The lad was proved to be of good character and the son of respectable parents.|English
LJ002-0174|Mr. Buxton's friends at once paid the forty shillings, and the boy was released.|English
LJ002-0175|The costs in heavier debts always doubled the sum; if the arrest was made in the country it trebled it.|English
LJ002-0176|Neild gives a list of the various items charged upon a debt of ten pounds, which included instructions to sue,|English
LJ002-0177|affidavit of debt, drawing praecipe (one pound, five shillings), capias, fee to officer on arrest,|English
LJ002-0178|affidavit of service, and many more, amounting in all to twenty-seven,|English
LJ002-0179|and costing eleven pounds, fifteen shillings, eight pence, within ten days.|English
LJ002-0180|Before dealing with the debtors in Newgate, I may refer incidentally|English
LJ002-0181|to those in other London prisons, for Newgate was not the only place of durance for these unfortunate people. There were also the King's Bench,|English
LJ002-0182|the Fleet, and the Marshalsea prisons especially devoted to them,|English
LJ002-0183|whilst Ludgate, the Giltspur Street, and Borough Compters also received them|English
LJ002-0184|the latter two being also a prison for felons and vagrants arrested within certain limits.|English
LJ002-0185|The King's Bench was a national prison, in which were confined all debtors arrested for debt or for contempt of the court of the King's Bench.|English
LJ002-0186|The population generally amounted to from five hundred to seven hundred, the accommodation being calculated for two hundred.|English
LJ002-0187|"Every new-comer was entitled to a ""chummage"" ticket, but did not always get it,"|English
LJ002-0188|being often obliged to pay a high rent for a bed at the coffee-house or in some room which was vacated by its regular occupant.|English
LJ002-0189|No fixed rates or rules governed the hiring out of rooms or parts of a room, and all sorts of imposition was practiced.|English
LJ002-0190|"The best, or at least the most influential prisoners, got lodging in the State House, which contained ""eight large handsome rooms."""|English
LJ002-0191|Besides those actually resident within the walls,|English
LJ002-0192|"another two hundred more or less took advantage of ""the rules,"" and lived outside within a circumference of two miles and a half."|English
LJ002-0193|In these cases security was given for the amount of the debt,|English
LJ002-0194|and a heavy fee at the rate of eight pounds per one hundred pounds, with four pounds for every additional hundred.|English
LJ002-0195|"Besides these, a number had the privilege of a ""run on the key,"" which allowed a prisoner to go into the rules for the day."|English
LJ002-0196|The foregoing rentals and payments for privileges, together with fees exacted on commitment and discharge, went to the marshal or keeper of the prison,|English
LJ002-0197|whose net annual income thus entirely derived from the impecunious amounted to between three and four thousand pounds.|English
LJ002-0198|The office of marshal had been hereditary,|English
LJ002-0199|but in the twenty-seventh George the second the right of presentation was bought by the Crown for ten thousand, five hundred pounds.|English
LJ002-0200|The marshal was supposed to be resident either within the prison or the rules.|English
LJ002-0201|He seems to have felt no responsibility as to the welfare or comfort of those in charge, and out of whom he made all his money.|English
LJ002-0202|"The prison was always in ""the most filthy state imaginable."""|English
LJ002-0203|The half or wholly starved prisoners fished for alms or food at the gratings.|English
LJ002-0204|When they were sick no more notice was taken of them than of a dog.|English
LJ002-0205|A man dying of liver complaint lay on the cold stones without a bed or food to eat.|English
LJ002-0206|Dissolute habits prevailed on all sides; drunkenness was universal, gambling perpetual.|English
LJ002-0207|"The yards were taken up with rackets and five courts, and here and there were ""bumble puppy grounds,"" a game in which the players rolled iron balls"|English
LJ002-0208|into holes marked with numbers.|English
LJ002-0209|How to make most profit out of the wretched denizens of the jail was the marshal's only care. He got a rent for the coffee-house and the bake-house;|English
LJ002-0210|the keeper of the large tap-room called the Brace, because it was once kept by two brothers named Partridge, also paid him toll.|English
LJ002-0211|The sale of spirits was forbidden, but gin could always be had at the whistling shops, where it was known as Moonshine, Sky Blue,|English
LJ002-0212|Mexico, and was consumed at the rate of a hogshead per week.|English
LJ002-0213|The Fleet, which stood in Farringdon Street,|English
LJ002-0214|was a prison for debtors and persons committed for contempt by the courts of Chancery, Exchequer, and Common Pleas.|English
LJ002-0215|It was so used for the date of the abolition of the Star Chamber in the sixteenth Charles the first|English
LJ002-0216|The shameful malpractices of Bambridge,|English
LJ002-0217|the warden of the Fleet at the commencement of the eighteenth century, are too well known to need more than a passing reference.|English
LJ002-0218|A committee of the House of Commons investigated the charges against Bambridge, who was proved to have connived at the escape of some debtors,|English
LJ002-0219|and to have been guilty of extortion to others. One Sir William Rich, Bart., he had loaded with heavy irons|English
LJ002-0220|In consequence of these disclosures, both Bambridge and Huggin, his predecessor in the office, were committed to Newgate,|English
LJ002-0221|and many reforms instituted. But the condition of the prison and its inmates remained unsatisfactory to the last.|English
LJ002-0222|It contained generally from six to seven hundred inmates, while another hundred more or less resided in the rules outside.|English
LJ002-0223|"The principle of ""chummage"" prevailed as in the King's Bench,"|English
LJ002-0224|but a number of rooms, fifteen more or less, were reserved for poor debtors under the name of Bartholomew Fair.|English
LJ002-0225|The rentals of rooms and fees went to the warden, whose income was two thousand three hundred seventy-two pounds.|English
LJ002-0226|The same evils of overcrowding, uncleanliness, want of medical attendance,|English
LJ002-0227|absence or neglect of divine service, were present as in the King's Bench, but in an exaggerated form.|English
LJ002-0228|The Committee on Jails reported that, quote, although the house of the warden looked into the court,|English
LJ002-0229|and the turnkeys slept in the prison, yet scenes of riot, drunkenness, and disorder were most prevalent, end quote.|English
LJ002-0230|The state of morals was disgraceful. Any woman obtained admission if sober, and if she got drunk she was not turned out.|English
LJ002-0231|There was no distinct place for the female debtors, who lived in the same galleries as the men.|English
LJ002-0232|Disturbances were frequent, owing to the riotous conduct of intoxicated women.|English
LJ002-0233|Twice a week there was a wine and beer club held at night, which lasted till two or three in the morning.|English
LJ002-0234|In the yard behind the prison|English
LJ002-0235|were places set apart for skittles, fives, and tennis, which strangers frequented as any other place of public amusement.|English
LJ002-0236|Matters were rather better at the Marshalsea.|English
LJ002-0237|This very ancient prison, which stood in the High Street, Southwark,|English
LJ002-0238|was used for debtors arrested for the lowest sums within twelve miles of the palace of Whitehall;|English
LJ002-0239|also for prisoners committed by the Admiralty Court.|English
LJ002-0240|At one time the Marshalsea was the receptacle of pirates, but none were committed to it after seventeen eighty-nine.|English
LJ002-0241|The court of the Marshalsea was instituted by Charles the first in the sixth year of his reign,|English
LJ002-0242|to be held before the steward of the royal household, the knight marshal, and the steward of the court,|English
LJ002-0243|with jurisdiction to hold pleas in all actions within the prescribed limits. The court was chiefly used for the recovery of small debts under ten pounds|English
LJ002-0244|but its business was much reduced by the extension of the Courts of Conscience.|English
LJ002-0245|The prison was a nest of abuses, like its neighbor the King's Bench|English
LJ002-0246|and came under the strong animadversion of the Jail Committee of seventeen twenty-nine.|English
LJ002-0247|As the business of the Marshalsea Court declined, the numbers in its prison diminished.|English
LJ002-0248|The population, as reported by the committee in eighteen fourteen, averaged about sixty,|English
LJ002-0249|and the prison, although wives and children resided within the walls, was not overcrowded.|English
LJ002-0250|Their conduct too was orderly on the whole.|English
LJ002-0251|Drunkenness was not common, chiefly because liquor was not to be had freely, although the tapster paid a rent of two guineas a week for permission to sell it.|English
LJ002-0252|"The inmates, who euphemistically styled themselves ""collegians,"""|English
LJ002-0253|were governed by rules which they themselves had framed, and under which subscriptions were levied|English
LJ002-0254|"and fines imposed for conduct disapproved of by the ""college."""|English
LJ002-0255|A court of the collegians was held every Monday to manage its affairs, at which all prisoners were required to attend.|English
LJ002-0256|A committee of collegians was elected to act as the executive, also a secretary or accountant to receive monies and keep books,|English
LJ002-0257|and a master of the ale-room, who kept this the scene of their revels clean, and saw that boiling water was provided for grog.|English
LJ002-0258|Bad language, quarreling, throwing water over one another was forbidden on pain of fine and being sent to Coventry;|English
LJ002-0259|but the prevailing moral tone may be guessed from the penalty inflicted upon persons singing obscene songs before nine p.m.|English
LJ002-0260|Yet the public opinion of the whole body seems to have checked dissipation.|English
LJ002-0261|The poorer prisoners were not in abject want, as in other prisons,|English
LJ002-0262|owing to many charitable gifts and bequests, which included annual donations from the Archbishop of Canterbury,|English
LJ002-0263|the Lord Steward of the Household, the steward and officers of the Marshalsea Court, and others.|English
LJ002-0264|Legacies had also been left to free a certain number of debtors, notably that of one hundred pounds per annum|English
LJ002-0265|left by a Mr. Henry Allnutt, who was long a prisoner in the Marshalsea, and came into a fortune while there.|English
LJ002-0266|His bequest, which was charged upon his manor at Goring, Oxon, and hence called the Oxford Charity,|English
LJ002-0267|was applied only to the release of poor debtors whom four pounds each could free.|English
LJ002-0268|The supreme control of the Marshalsea was vested in the marshal of the royal household; but although he drew a salary of five hundred pounds a year,|English
LJ002-0269|he did nothing beyond visiting the prison occasionally, and left the administration to the deputy marshal.|English
LJ002-0270|The latter's salary, with fees, the rent of the tap and of the chandler's shop, amounted to about six hundred pounds a year.|English
LJ002-0271|The compters of Ludgate, Giltspur Street, and the Borough were discontinued as debtors' prisons (as was Newgate also)|English
LJ002-0272|on the opening of Whitecross prison for debtors in eighteen fifteen.|English
LJ002-0273|Ludgate to the last was the debtors' prison for freemen of the city of London,|English
LJ002-0274|clergymen, proctors, attorneys, and persons specially selected by the Corporation.|English
LJ002-0275|At one time the Ludgate debtors, accompanied by the keeper,|English
LJ002-0276|went outside and beyond the prison to call on their creditors, and try to arrange their debts, but this practice was discontinued.|English
LJ002-0277|There were fifteen rooms of various sizes, and as the numbers imprisoned rarely exceeded five-and-twenty, the place was never overcrowded,|English
LJ002-0278|while the funds of several bequests and charities were applied in adding to the material comfort of the prisoners.|English
LJ002-0279|The Giltspur Street Compter received sheriffs' debtors, also felons, vagrants, and night charges.|English
LJ002-0280|It was generally crowded, as debtors who would have gone to the Poultry Compter were sent to Giltspur Street when the former was condemned as unfit to receive prisoners.|English
LJ002-0281|The demands for fees were excessive in Giltspur Street.|English
LJ002-0282|Those who could not pay were thrown into the wards with the night charges,|English
LJ002-0283|"and denied admission to the ""charity wards,"" which partook of all the benefits of bequests and donations to poor debtors."|English
LJ002-0284|The Borough Compter was in a disgraceful state to the last. The men's ward had an earth, or rather a mud, floor,|English
LJ002-0285|and was so unfit to sleep on that it had not been used for many years, so that the men and women associated together indiscriminately.|English
LJ002-0286|The rooms had no fireplaces, so it mattered little that no coals were allowed.|English
LJ002-0287|There were no beds or bedding, no straw even.|English
LJ002-0288|In one room Mr. Neild found a woman ill of a flux shut up with three men;|English
LJ002-0289|the latter raised eighteen pence among them to pay for a truss of straw for the poor woman to lie on.|English
LJ002-0290|Neild found the prisoners in the Borough Compter ragged, starving, and dirty.|English
LJ002-0291|I come now to the debtors in Newgate. The quarters they occupied were divided, as I have said, into three principal divisions|English
LJ002-0292|the master's side, the cabin side, and the common side. Payment of a fee of three shillings gained the debtor admission to the two first named;|English
LJ002-0293|those who could pay nothing went, as a matter of course, to the common side;|English
LJ002-0294|a further fee was, however, demanded from the new-comer before he was made free of either the master's or the cabin side.|English
LJ002-0295|"This was the reprehensible claim for ""garnish,"" which had already been abolished in all well-conducted prisons, but which still was demanded in Newgate."|English
LJ002-0296|Garnish on the cabin side was a guinea at entrance for coals, candles, brooms, etc., and a gallon of beer on discharge;|English
LJ002-0297|on the master's side it was thirteen and fourpence, and a gallon of beer on entrance, although Mr. Newman,|English
LJ002-0298|in his evidence in eighteen fourteen, said it was more,|English
LJ002-0299|and gave the garnish for the common side at that sum, which is five shillings more than Mr. Neild says was extorted on the common side.|English
LJ002-0300|Numerous tyrannies were practiced on all who would not and could not pay the garnish.|English
LJ002-0301|They were made to wash and swab the ward, or they were shut out from the ward fireplace, and forbidden to pass a chalked line drawn on the floor,|English
LJ002-0302|and so were unable either to warm themselves or to cook their food.|English
LJ002-0303|Besides these fees, legitimate and illegitimate, there were others which must be paid before release.|English
LJ002-0304|The sheriff demanded four shillings, six pence for his liberate, the jailer six shillings, ten pence more, and the turnkey two shillings;|English
LJ002-0305|and thus when the debtor's debt had been actually paid, or when he had abandoned his property to the creditors, and, almost destitute,|English
LJ002-0306|looked forward to his liberty, he was still delayed until he had paid a new debt arising, quote,|English
LJ002-0307|only out of a satisfaction of all his former debts, end quote. The fees were not always extorted, it is true;|English
LJ002-0308|nor was non-payment made a pretext for further imprisonment, thanks to the humanity of the jailer, or the funds provided by various charities.|English
LJ002-0309|There was this much honest forbearance in Newgate in these days,|English
LJ002-0310|that debtors who could afford the cabin and master's side were not permitted to share in the prison charities.|English
LJ002-0311|These were lumped together into a general fund,|English
LJ002-0312|and a calculation made as to the amount that might be expended per week from the whole sum, so that the latter might last out the year.|English
LJ002-0313|It generally ran to about six pounds per week. The money, which at one time had been distributed quarterly, and all went in drink,|English
LJ002-0314|was after eighteen oh seven, through the exertions of the keeper of the jail, spent in the purchase of necessaries.|English
LJ002-0315|But this weekly pittance did not go far when the debtors' side was crowded, as it often was;|English
LJ002-0316|notably as when numbers filled Newgate in anticipation of Lord Redesdale's bill for insolvent debtors,|English
LJ002-0317|and there were as many as three hundred and fifty prisoners in at one time.|English
LJ002-0318|The city also allowed the poor debtors fourteen ounces of bread daily, and their share of eight stone of meat, an allowance which never varied,|English
LJ002-0319|issued once a week, and divided as far as it would go -- a very precarious and uncertain ration.|English
LJ002-0320|The bread was issued every alternate day; and while some prisoners often ate their whole allowance at once,|English
LJ002-0321|others who arrived just after the time of distribution were often forty-eight hours without food. The latter might also be six days without meat.|English
LJ002-0322|"Share in the weekly allowance of meat might also be denied to debtors who had not paid ""garnish,"" as well as in the weekly grant from the charitable fund."|English
LJ002-0323|Hence starvation stared many in the face, unless friends from outside came to their assistance,|English
LJ002-0324|or the keeper made them a special grant of six pence per diem out of the common stock;|English
LJ002-0325|or the sixpenny allowance was claimed for the creditors, which seldom happened, owing to the expense the process entailed.|English
LJ002-0326|The poor debtors were not supplied with beds. Those who could pay the price might hire them from each other,|English
LJ002-0327|or from persons who made a trade of it, or they might bring their beds with them into the prison.|English
LJ002-0328|Failing any of these methods, seeing that straw was forbidden for fear of fire, they had to be satisfied with a couple of the rugs provided by the city|English
LJ002-0329|the supply of which was, however, limited, and there were not always enough to give bedding to all. The stock was diminished by theft;|English
LJ002-0330|female visitors carried them out of the prisons, or the debtors destroyed them when the weather was warm,|English
LJ002-0331|and they were not in great demand, in order to convert them into mop-heads or cleaning-rags.|English
LJ002-0332|Sometimes rugs were urgently required and not forthcoming;|English
LJ002-0333|a severe winter set in, the new stock had not been supplied by the contractors, and the poor debtors perished of cold.|English
LJ002-0334|Again, there was no regular allowance of fuel. Coals were purchased out of the garnish money and the charitable fund;|English
LJ002-0335|so were candles, salt, pepper, mops and brooms. But the latter could have been of little service. Dirt prevailed everywhere;|English
LJ002-0336|indeed the place, with its oak floors caulked with pitch, and smoked ceilings,|English
LJ002-0337|could not be made even to look clean while there was no obligation of personal cleanliness on individuals, who often came into the prison in filthy rags.|English
LJ002-0338|Only now and again, in extreme cases, an unusually nasty companion was stripped, haled to the pump,|English
LJ003-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section five: Newgate down to eighteen eighteen, part two.|English
LJ003-0002|The squalor and uncleanness of the debtors' side was intensified by constant overcrowding.|English
LJ003-0003|Prisoners were committed to it quite without reference to its capacity.|English
LJ003-0004|No remonstrance was attended to,|English
LJ003-0005|no steps taken to reduce the number of committals, and the governor was obliged to utilize the chapel as a day and night room.|English
LJ003-0006|Besides this, although the families of debtors were no longer permitted to live with them inside the jail,|English
LJ003-0007|hundreds of women and children came in every morning to spend the day there, and there was no limitation whatever to the numbers of visitors admitted to the debtors' side.|English
LJ003-0008|Friends arrived about nine a.m., and went out at nine p.m., when as many as two hundred visitors have been observed leaving the debtors' yards at one time.|English
LJ003-0009|The day passed in revelry and drunkenness. Although spirituous liquors were forbidden,|English
LJ003-0010|wine and beer might be had in any quantity, the only limitation being|English
LJ003-0011|that not more than one bottle of wine or one quart of beer could be issued at one time. No account was taken of the amount of liquors admitted in one day,|English
LJ003-0012|and debtors might practically have as much as they liked, if they could only pay for it.|English
LJ003-0013|No attempt was made to check drunkenness, beyond the penalty of shutting out friends from any ward in which a prisoner exceeded.|English
LJ003-0014|Quarreling among the debtors was not unfrequent. Blows were struck, and fights often ensued.|English
LJ003-0015|"For this and other acts of misconduct there was the discipline of the refractory ward, or ""strong room"" on the debtors' side."|English
LJ003-0016|Bad cases were removed to a cell on the felons' side, and here they were locked in solitary confinement for three days at a time.|English
LJ003-0017|Order throughout the debtors' side was preserved|English
LJ003-0018|and discipline maintained by a system open to grave abuses, and which had the prescription of long usage,|English
LJ003-0019|and which was never wholly rooted out for many years to come.|English
LJ003-0020|This was the pernicious plan of governing by prisoners, or of setting a favored few in authority over the many.|English
LJ003-0021|The head of the debtors' prison was a prisoner called the steward, who was chosen by the whole body from six whom the keeper nominated.|English
LJ003-0022|This steward was practically supreme.|English
LJ003-0023|All the allowances of food passed through his hands; he had the control of the poor-box for chance charities,|English
LJ003-0024|he collected the garnish money, and distributed the weekly grant from the prison charitable fund.|English
LJ003-0025|In the latter duties he was, however, supervised by three auditors, freely chosen by the prisoners among themselves.|English
LJ003-0026|The auditors were paid a shilling each for their services each time the poor-box was opened. The steward was also remunerated for his trouble.|English
LJ003-0027|He had a double allowance of bread, deducted, of course, from the already too limited portion of the rest,|English
LJ003-0028|and no doubt made the meat also pay toll.|English
LJ003-0029|Under the steward there were captains of wards, chosen in the same way, and performing analogous duties.|English
LJ003-0030|These subordinate chiefs were also rewarded out of the scanty prison rations.|English
LJ003-0031|The same system was extended to the criminal side, and cases were on record of the place of wardsman being sold for considerable sums.|English
LJ003-0032|So valuable were they deemed, that as much as fifty guineas was offered to the keeper for the post.|English
LJ003-0033|Enough has been said, probably, to prove that there was room for improvement in the condition and treatment of debtors in the prisons of the city of London.|English
LJ003-0034|This gradually was forced upon the consciousness of the Corporation,|English
LJ003-0035|and about eighteen twelve application was made to Parliament for funds to build a new debtors' prison.|English
LJ003-0036|Authority was given to raise money on the Orphans' Fund to the extent of ninety thousand pounds.|English
LJ003-0037|A site was purchased between Red Lion and White Cross streets, and a new prison planned,|English
LJ003-0038|which would accommodate the inmates of Newgate and of the three compters, Ludgate,|English
LJ003-0039|Giltspur Street, and the Poultry, or about four hundred and seventy-six in all.|English
LJ003-0040|The evils of association for these debtors were perpetuated, although the plan provided for the separation of the various contingents committed to it.|English
LJ003-0041|There was no lack of air and light for the new jail, and several exercising yards.|English
LJ003-0042|The completion of this very necessary building was, however, much delayed for want of funds,|English
LJ003-0043|and it was not ready to relieve Newgate till late in eighteen fifteen.|English
LJ003-0044|The reforms which were to be attempted in that prison|English
LJ003-0045|more particularly as regarded the classification of prisoners, and which were dependent on the space to be gained by the removal of the debtors,|English
LJ003-0046|could not be carried out till then. It is to be feared that long after the opening of White Cross Street prison,|English
LJ003-0047|Newgate continued to be a reproach to those responsible for its management.|English
LJ003-0048|I pass now to the criminal side of Newgate, which consisted of the six quarters or yards already enumerated and described.|English
LJ003-0049|The inmates of this part, as distinguished from the debtors, were comprised in four classes:|English
LJ003-0050|(one) those awaiting trial;|English
LJ003-0051|(two) persons under sentence of imprisonment for a fixed period, or until they shall have paid certain fines;|English
LJ003-0052|(three) transports awaiting removal to the colonies, and (four) capital convicts, condemned to death and awaiting execution.|English
LJ003-0053|At one time the whole of these different categories were thrown together pell-mell, young and old, the untried with the convicted.|English
LJ003-0054|An imperfect attempt at classification was, however, made in eighteen twelve, and a yard was as far as possible set apart for the untried,|English
LJ003-0055|or class (one), with whom, under the imperious demand for accommodation, were also associated the misdemeanants, or class (two).|English
LJ003-0056|This was the chapel yard, with its five wards, which were calculated to hold seventy prisoners, but often held many more.|English
LJ003-0057|A further sub-classification was attempted by separating at night those charged with misdemeanors from those charged with felony,|English
LJ003-0058|but all mingled freely during the day in the yard.|English
LJ003-0059|The sleeping accommodation in the chapel-yard wards, and indeed throughout the prison, consisted of a barrack bed,|English
LJ003-0060|which was a wooden flooring on a slightly inclined plane, with a beam running across the top to serve as a pillow.|English
LJ003-0061|No beds were issued, only two rugs per prisoner.|English
LJ003-0062|When each sleeper had the full lateral space allotted to him, it amounted to one foot and a half on the barrack bed;|English
LJ003-0063|but when the ward was obliged to accommodate double the ordinary number, as was frequently the case,|English
LJ003-0064|the sleepers covered the entire floor, with the exception of a passage in the middle.|English
LJ003-0065|All the misdemeanants, whatever their offense, were lodged in this chapel ward.|English
LJ003-0066|As many various and, according to our ideas, heinous crimes came under this head,|English
LJ003-0067|in the then existing state of the law,|English
LJ003-0068|the man guilty of a common assault found himself side by side with the fraudulent, or others who had attempted abominable crimes.|English
LJ003-0069|In this heterogeneous society were also thrown the unfortunate journalists to whom I have already referred, and on whom imprisonment in Newgate|English
LJ003-0070|was frequently adjudged for so-called libels, or too out-spoken comments in print.|English
LJ003-0071|It was particularly recommended by the Committee on Jails in eighteen fourteen|English
LJ003-0072|that some other and less mixed prison should be used for the confinement of persons convicted of libels. But this suggestion was ignored.|English
LJ003-0073|Indeed the partial classification attempted seems to have been abandoned within a year or two.|English
LJ003-0074|The Hon. H. G. Bennet, who visited Newgate in eighteen seventeen, saw in one yard, in a total of seventy-two prisoners,|English
LJ003-0075|thirty-five tried and thirty-seven untried. Of the former, three were transports for life,|English
LJ003-0076|four for fourteen years, and three of them persons sentenced to fines or short imprisonment -- one for little more than a month.|English
LJ003-0077|Two of the untried were for murder, and several for house-breaking and highway robbery.|English
LJ003-0078|Nor were the misdemeanants and bail prisoners any longer separated from those whose crimes were of a more serious character.|English
LJ003-0079|Mr. Bennet refers to a gentleman confined for want of bail, who occupied a room with five others|English
LJ003-0080|two committed by the Bankruptcy Commissioner, one for perjury, and two transports.|English
LJ003-0081|Persons convicted of publishing libels were still immured in the same rooms with transports and felons.|English
LJ003-0082|The middle yard, as far as its limits would permit, was appropriated to felons and transports. The wards here were generally very crowded.|English
LJ003-0083|Each ward was calculated to hold twenty-four, allowing each individual one foot and a half;|English
LJ003-0084|Quote, a common-sized man, says the keeper, Mr. Newman, can turn in nineteen inches, end quote.|English
LJ003-0085|These twenty-four could just sleep on the barrack bed; when the number was higher, and it often rose to forty, the surplus had to sleep on the floor.|English
LJ003-0086|The crowding was in consequence of the delay in removing transports.|English
LJ003-0087|These often remained in Newgate for six months, sometimes a year, in some cases longer;|English
LJ003-0088|in one, for seven years -- that of a man sentenced to death, for whom great interest had been made, but whom it was not thought right to pardon.|English
LJ003-0089|Occasionally the transports made themselves so useful in the jail that they were passed over.|English
LJ003-0090|"Mr. Newman admitted that he had petitioned that certain ""trusty men"" might be left in the jail."|English
LJ003-0091|Constantly associated with these convicted felons were numbers of juveniles, infants of tender years.|English
LJ003-0092|There were frequently in the middle yard seven or eight children, the youngest barely nine,|English
LJ003-0093|the oldest only twelve or thirteen, exposed to all the contaminating influences of the place.|English
LJ003-0094|Mr. Bennet mentions also the case of young men of better stamp, clerks in city offices, and youths of good parentage,|English
LJ003-0095|Quote, in this dreadful situation, end quote. who had been rescued from the hulks through the kindness and attention of the Secretary of State.|English
LJ003-0096|Quote, yet they had been long enough, he goes on to say, in the prison associated with the lowest and vilest criminals,|English
LJ003-0097|with convicts of all ages and characters, to render it next to impossible but that, with the obliteration of all sense of self-respect,|English
LJ003-0098|the inevitable consequence of such a situation, their morals must have been destroyed;|English
LJ003-0099|and though distress or the seduction of others might have led to the commission of this their first offense,|English
LJ003-0100|yet the society they were driven to live in, the language they daily heard, and the lessons they were taught in this academy,|English
LJ003-0101|must have had a tendency to turn them into the world hardened and accomplished in the ways of vice and crime. End quote.|English
LJ003-0102|Mr. Buxton, in the work already quoted, instances another grievous case of the horrors of indiscriminate association in Newgate.|English
LJ003-0103|It was that of a person, quote, who practiced in the law, and who was connected by marriage with some very respectable families.|English
LJ003-0104|Having been committed to Clerkenwell,|English
LJ003-0105|he was sent on to Newgate in a coach, handcuffed to a noted house-breaker, who was afterwards cast for death.|English
LJ003-0106|The first night in Newgate, and for the subsequent fortnight,|English
LJ003-0107|he slept in the same bed with a highwayman on one side, and a man charged with murder on the other.|English
LJ003-0108|Spirits were freely introduced, and although he at first abstained,|English
LJ003-0109|he found he must adopt the manners of his companions, or that his life would be in danger.|English
LJ003-0110|They viewed him with some suspicion, as one of whom they knew nothing.|English
LJ003-0111|He was in consequence put out of the protection of their internal law, end quote. Their code was a subject of some curiosity.|English
LJ003-0112|When any prisoner committed an offense against the community or against an individual, he was tried by a court in the jail.|English
LJ003-0113|A prisoner, generally the oldest and most dexterous thief,|English
LJ003-0114|was appointed judge, and a towel tied in knots was hung on each side in imitation of a wig.|English
LJ003-0115|"The judge sat in proper form; he was punctiliously styled ""my lord."""|English
LJ003-0116|A jury having been selected and duly sworn, the culprit was then arraigned. Justice, however, was not administered with absolute integrity.|English
LJ003-0117|A bribe to the judge was certain to secure acquittal, and the neglect of the formality was as certainly followed by condemnation.|English
LJ003-0118|Various punishments were inflicted, the heaviest of which was standing in the pillory.|English
LJ003-0119|This was carried out by putting the criminal's head through the legs of a chair, and stretching out his arms and tying them to the legs.|English
LJ003-0120|The culprit was then compelled to carry the chair about with him.|English
LJ003-0121|But all punishments might readily be commuted into a fine to be spent in gin for judge and jury.|English
LJ003-0122|The prisoner mentioned above was continually persecuted by trials of this kind.|English
LJ003-0123|The most trifling acts were magnified into offenses.|English
LJ003-0124|He was charged with moving something which should not be touched, with leaving a door open, or coughing maliciously to the disturbance of his companions.|English
LJ003-0125|The evidence was invariably sufficient to convict, and the judge never hesitated to inflict the heaviest penalties.|English
LJ003-0126|The unfortunate man was compelled at length to adopt the habits of his associates;|English
LJ003-0127|Quote, by insensible degrees he began to lose his repugnance to their society,|English

LJ003-0130|His wife visited him in Newgate, and wrote a pitiable account of the state in which she found her husband.|English
LJ003-0131|He was an inmate of the same ward with others of the most dreadful sort, quote,|English
LJ003-0132|whose language and manners, whose female associates of the most abandoned description, and the scenes consequent with such lost wretches|English
LJ003-0133|prevented me from going inside but seldom, and I used to communicate with him through the bars from the passage. End quote.|English
LJ003-0134|One day he was too ill to come down and meet her.|English
LJ003-0135|She went up to the ward and found him lying down, quote,|English
LJ003-0136|pale as death, very ill, and in a dreadfully dirty state, the wretches making game of him, and enjoying my distress;|English
LJ003-0137|and I learned he had been up with the others the whole night.|English
LJ003-0138|Though they could not force him to gamble, he was compelled to drink,|English
LJ003-0139|and I was obliged afterwards to let him have five shillings to pay his share,|English
LJ003-0140|otherwise he would have been stripped of his clothes. End quote.|English
LJ003-0141|Felons who could pay the price were permitted, irrespective of their character or offenses,|English
LJ003-0142|to purchase the greater ease and comfort of the master's side.|English
LJ003-0143|The entrance fee was at least thirteen shillings, six pence a head, with half-a-crown a week more for bed and bedding,|English
LJ003-0144|the wards being furnished with barrack bedsteads, upon which each prisoner had the regulation allowance of sleeping room|English
LJ003-0145|or about a foot and a half laterally. These fees were in reality a substantial contribution towards the expenses of the jail;|English
LJ003-0146|without them the keeper declared that he could not pay the salaries of turnkeys and servants, nor keep the prison going at all.|English
LJ003-0147|Besides the jail fees, there was garnish of half-a-guinea, collected by the steward,|English
LJ003-0148|and spent in providing coals, candles, plates, knives, and forks; while all the occupants of this part of the prison|English
LJ003-0149|supported themselves; they had the ration of prison bread only,|English
LJ003-0150|but they had no share in the prison meat or other charities, and they or their friends found them in food.|English
LJ003-0151|All who could scrape together the cash seem to have gladly availed themselves of the privilege of entering the master's side.|English
LJ003-0152|It was the only way to escape the horrors, the distress, penury, and rags of the common yards.|English
LJ003-0153|Idleness was not so universally the rule in this part of the jail.|English
LJ003-0154|Artisans and others were at liberty to work at their trades, provided they were not dangerous.|English
LJ003-0155|Tailoring and shoemaking was permitted, but it was deemed unsafe to allow a carpenter or blacksmith to have his tools.|English
LJ003-0156|All the money earned by prisoners was at their own disposal, and was spent almost habitually in drink, chambering, and wantonness.|English
LJ003-0157|The best accommodation the jail could offer was reserved for the prisoners on the state side,|English
LJ003-0158|from whom still higher fees were exacted, with the same discreditable idea of swelling the revenues of the prison.|English
LJ003-0159|To constitute this the aristocratic quarter, unwarrantable demands were made upon the space properly allotted to the female felons,|English
LJ003-0160|and no lodger was rejected, whatever his status, who offered himself and could bring grist to the mill.|English
LJ003-0161|The luxury of the state side was for a long time open to all who could pay|English
LJ003-0162|the convicted felon, the transport awaiting removal, the lunatic whose case was still undecided,|English
LJ003-0163|the misdemeanant tried or untried, the debtor who wished to avoid the discomfort of the crowded debtors' side, the outspoken newspaper editor,|English
LJ003-0164|or the daring reporter of parliamentary debates.|English
LJ003-0165|The better class of inmate complained bitterly of this enforced companionship with the vile,|English
LJ003-0166|association at one time forbidden by custom, but which greed and rapacity long made the rule.|English
LJ003-0167|The fee for admission to the state side, as fixed by the table of fees, was three guineas, but Mr. Newman declared that he never took more than two.|English
LJ003-0168|Ten and sixpence a week more was charged as rent for a single bed; where two or more slept in a bed the rent was seven shillings a week each.|English
LJ003-0169|Prisoners who could afford it sometimes paid for four beds, at the rate of twenty-eight shillings, and so secured the luxury of a private room.|English
LJ003-0170|A Mr. Lundy, charged with forgery, was thus accommodated on the state side for upwards of five years.|English
LJ003-0171|But the keeper protested that no single prisoner could thus monopolize space if the state side was crowded.|English
LJ003-0172|The keeper went still further in his efforts to make money.|English
LJ003-0173|He continued the ancient practice of letting out a portion of his own house, and by a poetical fiction treated it as an annex of the state side.|English
LJ003-0174|Mr. Davison, sent to Newgate for embezzlement, and whose case is given in the preceding chapter,|English
LJ003-0175|was accommodated with a room in Mr. Newman's house at the extravagant rental of thirty guineas per week;|English
LJ003-0176|Mr. Cobbett was also a lodger of Mr. Newman's; and so were any members of the aristocracy,|English
LJ003-0177|if they happened to be in funds -- among whom was the Marquis of Sligo in eighteen eleven.|English
LJ003-0178|The female felons' wards I shall describe at length in the next chapter,|English
LJ003-0179|which will deal with Mrs. Fry's philanthropic exertions at this period in this particular part of the prison.|English
LJ003-0180|These wards were always full to overflowing; sometimes double the number the rooms could accommodate were crowded into them.|English
LJ003-0181|There was a master's side for females who could pay the usual fees, but they associated with the rest in the one narrow yard common to all.|English
LJ003-0182|The tried and the untried, young and old, were herded together|English

LJ003-0185|There was no separation even for the women under sentence of death, who lived in a common and perpetually crowded ward.|English
LJ003-0186|Only when the order of execution came down were those about to suffer placed apart in one of the rooms in the arcade of the middle ward.|English
LJ003-0187|I have kept till the last that part of the prison which was usually the last resting-place of so many.|English
LJ003-0188|The old press yard has been fully described in a previous chapter.|English
LJ003-0189|The name still survived in the new press yard, which was the receptacle of the male condemned prisoners. It was generally crowded, like the rest of the prison.|English
LJ003-0190|Except in murder cases, where the execution was generally very promptly performed,|English
LJ003-0191|strange and inconceivable delay occurred in carrying out the extreme sentence.|English
LJ003-0192|Hence there was a terrible accumulation of prisoners in the condemned cells.|English

LJ003-0205|Those who were thus reckless reacted upon the penitent who knew their days were numbered,|English
LJ003-0206|and their gibes and jollity counteracted the ordinary's counsels or the independent preacher's earnest prayers.|English
LJ003-0207|For while Roman Catholics and Dissenters were encouraged to see ministers of their own persuasion,|English
LJ003-0208|a number of amateurs were ever ready to give their gratuitous ministrations to the condemned.|English
LJ003-0209|The prisoners in the press yard had free access during the day to the yard and large day room;|English
LJ003-0210|at night they were placed in the fifteen cells, two, three, or more together, according to the total number to be accommodated.|English
LJ003-0211|They were never left quite alone for fear of suicide, and for the same reason they were searched for weapons or poisons.|English
LJ003-0212|But they nevertheless frequently managed to secrete the means of making away with themselves, and accomplished their purpose.|English
LJ003-0213|Convicted murderers were kept continuously in the cells on bread and water,|English
LJ003-0214|in couples, from the time of sentence to that of execution, which was about three or four days generally,|English
LJ003-0215|from Friday to Monday, so as to include one Sunday, on which day there was a special service for the condemned in the prison chapel.|English
LJ003-0216|This latter was an ordeal which all dreaded, and many avoided by denying their faith.|English
LJ003-0217|The condemned occupied an open pew in the center of the chapel, hung with black; in front of them, upon a table, was a black coffin in full view.|English
LJ003-0218|The chapel was filled with a curious but callous congregation, who came to stare at the miserable people thus publicly exposed.|English
LJ003-0219|Well might Mr. Bennet write that the condition of the condemned side was the most prominent of the manifold evils in the present system of Newgate,|English
LJ003-0220|quote, so discreditable to the metropolis, end quote.|English
LJ003-0221|Yet it must have been abundantly plain to the reader that the other evils existing were great and glaring. A brief summary of them will best prove this.|English
LJ003-0222|The jail was neither suitable nor sufficiently large. It was not even kept weather-tight.|English
LJ003-0223|The roof of the female prison, says the grand jury in their presentment in eighteen thirteen, let in the rain.|English
LJ003-0224|Supplies of common necessaries, such as have now been part of the furniture of every British jail for many years,|English
LJ003-0225|were meager or altogether absent.|English
LJ003-0226|The rations of food were notoriously inadequate, and so carelessly distributed, that many were left to starve.|English
LJ003-0227|So unjust and unequal was the system, that the allowance to convicted criminals was better than that of the innocent debtor,|English
LJ003-0228|and the general insufficiency was such|English
LJ003-0229|that it multiplied beyond all reason the number of visitors, many of whom came merely as the purveyors of food to their friends.|English
LJ003-0230|The prison allowances were eked out by the broken victuals generously given by several eating-house keepers in the city,|English
LJ003-0231|such as Messrs. Birch of Cornhill and Messrs. Leach and Dollimore of Ludgate Hill.|English
LJ003-0232|These were fetched away in a large tub on a truck by a turnkey.|English
LJ003-0233|Amongst the heap was often the meat that had made turtle soup, which, when heated and stirred together in a saucepan, was said to be very good eating.|English
LJ003-0234|The bedding was scanty; fuel and light had to be purchased out of prisoners' private means; clothing was issued but rarely,|English
LJ003-0235|even to prisoners almost in nakedness, and as a special charitable gift. Extortion was practiced right and left.|English
LJ003-0236|Garnish continued to be demanded long after it had disappeared in other and better-regulated prisons.|English
LJ003-0237|The fees on reception and discharge must be deemed exorbitant, when it is remembered the impoverished class who usually crowded the jail;|English
LJ003-0238|and they were exacted to relieve a rich corporation from paying for the maintenance of their own prison.|English
LJ003-0239|This imposition of fees left prisoners destitute on their discharge, without funds to support them in their first struggle to recommence life,|English
LJ003-0240|with ruined character, bad habits, and often bad health contracted in the jail.|English
LJ003-0241|A further and a more iniquitous method of extorting money|English
LJ003-0242|was still practiced, that of loading newly-arrived prisoners until they paid certain fees.|English
LJ003-0243|Ironing was still the rule, not only for the convicted, but for those charged with felonies; only the misdemeanants escaped.|English
LJ003-0244|"At the commencement of every sessions, such of the untried as had purchased ""easement"" of irons were called up and re-fettered,"|English
LJ003-0245|preparatory to their appearance in the Old Bailey. Irons were seldom removed from the convicted until discharge;|English
LJ003-0246|sometimes the wearer was declared medically unfit, or he obtained release by long good conduct,|English
LJ003-0247|or the faithful discharge of some petty office, such as gatesman or captain of a ward.|English
LJ003-0248|The irons weighed from three to four pounds, but heavier irons, seven or eight pounds' weight,|English
LJ003-0249|were imposed in case of misconduct; and when there had been an attempt at escape,|English
LJ003-0250|the culprit was chained down to the floor by running a chain through his irons which prevented him from climbing to the window of his cell.|English
LJ003-0251|Among other excuses offered for thus manacling all almost without exception, was that it was the best and safest method|English
LJ003-0252|of distinguishing a prisoner from a stranger and temporary visitor.|English
LJ003-0253|Clothes or prison uniform would not have served the purpose, for a disguise can be rapidly and secretly put on,|English
LJ003-0254|whereas irons cannot well be exchanged without loss of time and attracting much attention.|English
LJ003-0255|The unchecked admission of crowds of visitors to the felons' as well as the debtors' side was another unmixed evil.|English
LJ003-0256|By this means spirits, otherwise unattainable and strictly prohibited, were smuggled into the jail.|English
LJ003-0257|Searches were made certainly, but they were too often superficial, or they might be evaded by a trifling bribe.|English
LJ003-0258|Hence the frequent cases of drunkenness, of which no notice was taken, unless people grew riotous in their cups|English
LJ003-0259|and attracted attention by their disorderly behavior.|English
LJ003-0260|Another frightful consequence of this indiscriminate admission was the influx of numbers of abandoned women,|English
LJ003-0261|only a few of whom had the commendable prudery to pass themselves off as the wives of prisoners.|English
LJ003-0262|"Any reputed, and indeed any real, wife might spend the night in Newgate if she would pay the shilling fee, commonly known as the ""bad money,"""|English
LJ003-0263|which might have done something towards increasing the prison receipts, had it not been appropriated by the turnkey who winked at this evasion of the rules.|English
LJ003-0264|Among the daily visitors were members of the criminal classes still at large,|English
LJ003-0265|the thieves and burglars who carried on the active business of their profession, from which their confederates were temporarily debarred.|English
LJ003-0266|One notorious character, while a prisoner awaiting transfer to the hulks,|English
LJ003-0267|kept open house, so to speak, and entertained daily within the walls a select party of the most noted thieves in London.|English
LJ003-0268|This delectable society enticed into their set a clerk who had been imprisoned for fraud,|English
LJ003-0269|and offered him half the booty if he would give full information as to the transactions and correspondence of his late employers.|English
LJ003-0270|Owing to the facility of intercourse between inside and outside, many crimes were doubtless hatched in Newgate.|English
LJ003-0271|Some of the worst and most extensive burglaries were planned there.|English
LJ003-0273|I believe, says Mr. Bennet in the letter already largely quoted,|English
LJ003-0274|that there is no place in the metropolis where more crimes are projected or where stolen property is more secreted than in Newgate.|English
LJ003-0275|These malpractices were fostered by the absence of all supervision and the generally unbroken idleness.|English
LJ003-0276|Although attempted partially at Bridewell, and more systematically at the new Millbank penitentiary,|English
LJ003-0277|but just open (eighteen sixteen), the regular employment of prisoners had never yet been accepted as a principle in the metropolitan prisons.|English
LJ003-0278|Insuperable difficulties were still supposed to stand in the way of any general employment of prisoners at their trades.|English
LJ003-0279|There was fear as to the unrestricted use of tools,|English
LJ003-0280|limits of space, the interference of the ill-disposed, who would neither work nor let others do so,|English
LJ003-0281|and the danger of losing material, raw or manufactured.|English
LJ003-0282|Many years were to elapse before these objections should be fairly met and universally overcome.|English
LJ003-0283|It was not strange, therefore, that the inmates of Newgate should turn their unoccupied brains and idle hands to all manner of mischief;|English
LJ003-0284|that when they were not carousing, plotting, or scheming,|English
LJ003-0285|they should gamble with dice or cards, and play at bumble puppy or some other disreputable game of chance.|English
LJ003-0286|The report of the Committee of the House of Commons painted so black a picture of Newgate as then conducted, that the Corporation were roused in very shame|English
LJ003-0287|to undertake some kind of reform.|English
LJ003-0288|The above-mentioned report was ordered to be printed upon the ninth May.|English
LJ003-0289|Upon the twenty-ninth July the same year,|English
LJ003-0290|the court of aldermen appointed a committee of its own body, assisted by the town clerk, Mr. Dance, city surveyor, son to the architect of Newgate,|English
LJ003-0291|and Mr. Addison, keeper of Newgate, to make a visitation of the jails supposed to be the best managed, including those of Petworth and Gloucester.|English
LJ003-0292|This committee was to compare allowances, examine rules, and certify as to the condition of prisoners;|English
LJ003-0293|also to make such proposals as might appear salutary, and calculated to improve Newgate and the rest of the city jails.|English
LJ003-0294|This committee made its report in September the following year, and an excellent report it is, so far as its recommendations are concerned.|English
LJ003-0295|The committee seems to have fully realized, even at this early date (eighteen fifteen),|English
LJ003-0296|many of the indispensable conditions of a model prison according to modern ideas.|English
LJ003-0297|It admitted the paramount necessity|English
LJ003-0298|for giving every prisoner a sleeping cell to himself, an amount of enlightenment which is hardly general among European nations at this|English
LJ003-0299|the latter end of the nineteenth century, several of which still fall far short of our English ideal,|English
LJ003-0300|that all prisoners should always be in separate cells by night, and those of short sentences by day.|English
LJ003-0301|It recommended day cells or rooms for regular labor, which should be compulsory upon all transports and prisoners sentenced to hard labor,|English
LJ003-0302|the work being constant and suitable, with certain hours of relaxation and for food and exercise.|English
LJ003-0303|The personal cleanliness of all prisoners was to be insisted upon; they should be made to wash at least once a day,|English
LJ003-0304|with the penalty of forfeiting the day's allowance of food, an increase of which the committee had recommended.|English
LJ003-0305|The provision of more baths was also suggested, and the daily sweeping out of the prison.|English
LJ003-0306|The clothes of prisoners arriving dirty, or in rags, should be fumigated before worn in the jail,|English
LJ003-0307|but as yet no suggestion was made to provide prison uniform.|English
LJ003-0308|A laundry should be established, and a matron appointed on the female side, where all the prisoners' washing could be performed.|English
LJ003-0309|Proper hours for locking and unlocking prisoners should be insisted upon;|English
LJ003-0310|a bell should give notice thereof, and of meal-hours, working-hours, or of escapes.|English
LJ003-0311|The committee took upon itself to lay down stringent rules for the discipline of the prison.|English
LJ003-0312|The jailer should be required to visit every part and see every prisoner daily; the chaplain should perform service, visit the sick,|English
LJ003-0313|instruct the prisoners, quote, give spiritual advice and administer religious consolation, end quote. to all who might need them;|English
LJ003-0314|the surgeon should see all prisoners, whether ill or well, once a week, and take general charge of the infirmaries.|English
LJ003-0315|All three, governor, chaplain, and surgeon, should keep journals, which should be inspected periodically by the visiting magistrates.|English
LJ003-0316|It should be peremptorily forbidden to the keeper or any officer to make a pecuniary profit out of the supplies of food, fuel, or other necessaries.|English
LJ003-0317|No prisoner should be allowed to obtain superior accommodation on the payment of any fees. Fees indeed should be generally abolished, garnish also.|English
LJ003-0318|No prisoners should in future be ironed, except in cases of misconduct,|English
LJ003-0319|provided only that their security was not jeopardized, and dependent upon the enforcement of another new rule,|English
LJ003-0320|which recommended restrictions upon the number of visitors admitted.|English
LJ003-0321|No wine or beer should be in future admitted into or sold in the jail,|English
LJ003-0322|except for the use of the debtors, or as medical comforts for the infirmary.|English
LJ003-0323|Drunkenness, if it ever occurred, should be visited with severe punishment;|English
LJ003-0324|gaming of all sorts should be peremptorily forbidden under heavy pains and penalties.|English
LJ003-0325|The feelings of the condemned prisoners should no longer be outraged by their exposure in the chapel, and the chapel should be rearranged,|English
LJ003-0326|so that the various classes might be seated separately, and so as not to see each other.|English
LJ003-0327|It will hardly be denied that these proposals went to the root of the matter.|English
LJ003-0328|Had they been accepted in their entirety, little fault could in future have been found with the managers of Newgate.|English
LJ003-0329|In common justice to them, it must be admitted that immediate effect was given to all that could be easily carried out.|English
LJ003-0330|The state side ceased to exist, and the female prisoners thus regained the space of which their quadrangle had been robbed.|English
LJ003-0331|The privileges of the master's side also disappeared; fees were nominally abolished, and garnish was scotched, although not yet killed outright.|English
LJ003-0332|A certain number of bedsteads were provided, and there was a slight increase in the ration of bread.|English
LJ003-0333|But here the recommendations touched at once upon the delicate subject of expense, and it is clear that the committee hesitated on this score.|English
LJ003-0334|It made this too the excuse for begging the most important issue of the whole question.|English
LJ003-0335|The committee did not deny the superior advantages offered by such prisons as Gloucester and Petworth,|English
LJ003-0336|but it at once deprecated the idea that the city could follow the laudable example thus set in the provinces. Quote,|English
LJ003-0337|Were a metropolitan prison erected on the same lines, with all the space not only for air and exercise, but for day rooms and sleeping cells|English
LJ003-0338|End quote. it would cover some thirty acres, and cost a great deal more than the city, with the example of Whitecross Street prison before it,|English
LJ003-0339|could possibly afford.|English
LJ003-0340|The committee does not seem to have yet understood that Newgate could be only and properly replaced|English
LJ003-0341|by a new jail built on the outskirts, as Holloway eventually was, and permitted itself to be altogether countered|English
LJ003-0342|and checked in its efforts towards reform by the prohibitory costliness of the land about Newgate.|English
LJ003-0343|With the seeming impossibility of extending the limits of the prison as it then stood,|English
LJ003-0344|all chances of classification and separation vanished, and the greatest evils remained untouched.|English
LJ003-0345|All the committee could do in this respect was to throw the responsibility on others.|English
LJ003-0346|It pointed out that the Government was to blame for the overcrowding, and might diminish it if it chose.|English
LJ003-0347|It was very desirable that there should be a more speedy removal of transports from Newgate to the ships.|English
LJ003-0348|Again, there was the new Millbank penitentiary now ready for occupation.|English
LJ003-0349|Why not relieve Newgate by drawing more largely upon the superior accommodation which Millbank offered?|English
LJ004-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section seven: The beginnings of prison reform.|English
LJ004-0002|While Mrs. Fry was diligently engaged upon her self-imposed task in Newgate,|English
LJ004-0003|other earnest people, inspired doubtless by her noble example, were stirred up to activity in the same great work.|English
LJ004-0004|It began to be understood that prison reform could only be compassed by continuous and combined effort.|English
LJ004-0005|The pleadings, however eloquent, of a single individual were unable to more than partially remedy the widespread and colossal evils of British prisons.|English
LJ004-0006|Howard's energy and devotion were rewarded by lively sympathy, but the desire to improve which followed his exposures was but short-lived.|English
LJ004-0007|It was so powerless against the persistent neglect of those intrusted with prison management, that, five-and-twenty years later,|English
LJ004-0008|Mr. Neild, a second Howard,|English
LJ004-0009|as indefatigable and self-sacrificing, found by personal visitation that the condition of jails throughout the kingdom was,|English
LJ004-0010|with a few bright exceptions, still deplorable and disgraceful.|English
LJ004-0011|"Mr. Neild was compelled to admit in eighteen twelve that ""the great reformation produced by Howard"|English
LJ004-0012|was in several places merely temporary:|English
LJ004-0013|some prisons that had been ameliorated under the persuasive influence of his kind advice were relapsing into their former horrid state of privation,|English
LJ004-0014|filthiness, severity, or neglect; many new dungeons had aggravated the evils against which his sagacity could not but remonstrate;|English
LJ004-0015|"the motives for a transient amendment were becoming paralyzed, and the effect had ceased with the cause."""|English
LJ004-0016|I have shown in a previous chapter what Newgate was at this period, despite a vast expenditure and boasted efforts to introduce reforms.|English
LJ004-0017|Some of the county jails, and one or two borough jails, had been rebuilt,|English
LJ004-0018|generally through the personal activity of influential and benevolent local magnates, but the true principles of prison construction|English
LJ004-0019|"were as yet but imperfectly understood, and such portions of the ""improved"" jails of that period as were still extant a few years back,"|English
LJ004-0020|contrast ludicrously with the prison architecture based upon a century's experience of our own age.|English
LJ004-0021|The neglect of prison reform in those days was not to be visited upon the legislature.|English
LJ004-0022|The executive, although harassed by internal commotion and foreign war, was not entirely callous to the crying need for amelioration in jails.|English
LJ004-0023|Measures remedial, although at best partial and incomplete, were introduced from time to time.|English
LJ004-0024|Thus in eighteen thirteen the exaction of jail fees had been forbidden by law,|English
LJ004-0025|and two other acts more peremptory and precise followed on the same subject in succeeding years.|English
LJ004-0026|In eighteen fourteen a bill was brought in to insist upon the appointment of chaplains in jails, and when this had passed into law,|English
LJ004-0027|it was subsequently amplified, and the rates of salaries fixed.|English
LJ004-0028|Various acts were also passed to consolidate and amend previous jail acts.|English
LJ004-0029|The erection of new prison buildings was made imperative under certain conditions and following certain rules|English
LJ004-0030|the principle of classification was freshly enunciated; prison regulations were framed for general observance.|English
LJ004-0031|But the effect of this legislation was rather weakened by the remoteness of the pressure exercised.|English
LJ004-0032|The onus of improvement lay upon the magistracy, the local authorities administering local funds,|English
LJ004-0033|and they were not threatened with any particular penalties if they evaded or ignored the new acts.|English
LJ004-0034|Moreover, the laws applied more particularly to county jurisdictions.|English
LJ004-0035|The borough jails, those in fact under corporate management, were not included in the new measures;|English
LJ004-0036|it was hoped that their rulers would hire accommodation in the county prisons, and that the inferior establishments would in course of time disappear.|English
LJ004-0037|Yet the borough jails were destined to survive many years, and to exhibit for a long time to come all the worst features of jail mismanagement.|English
LJ004-0038|It was in eighteen seventeen that a small band of philanthropists resolved to form themselves into an association for the improvement of prison discipline.|English
LJ004-0039|They were hopeless of any general reform by the action of the executive alone.|English
LJ004-0040|They felt that private enterprise might|English
LJ004-0041|with advantage step in, and by the collection and diffusion of information, and the reiteration of sound advice, greatly assist the good work.|English
LJ004-0042|The association was organized under the most promising auspices.|English
LJ004-0043|A king's son, the Duke of Gloucester, was the patron; among the vice-presidents were many great peers of the realm|English
LJ004-0044|several bishops, and a number of members of the House of Commons, including Mr. Manners Sutton,|English
LJ004-0045|Mr. Sturges Bourne, Sir James Mackintosh, Sir James Scarlett, and William Wilberforce.|English
LJ004-0046|An active committee was appointed, comprising many names already well known, some of them destined to become famous in the annals of philanthropy.|English
LJ004-0047|One of the moving spirits was the Honorable H. G. Bennet, M.P., whose vigorous protests against the lamentable condition of Newgate have already been recorded.|English
LJ004-0048|Mrs. Fry's brother, Mr. Samuel Hoare, Junior, was chairman of the committee, on which also served many noted members of the Society of Friends|English
LJ004-0049|Mr. Gurney, Mr. Fry, Messrs. Forster, and Mr. T. F. Buxton, the coadjutor of Wilberforce in the great anti-slavery struggle.|English
LJ004-0050|Mr. Buxton had already been associated with Mrs. Fry in the Newgate visitation, and his attention had thus been drawn to the neglected state of English prisons.|English
LJ004-0051|"When in Belgium he had examined with great satisfaction the admirable management of the great ""Maison de Force"" at Ghent,"|English
LJ004-0052|which Howard had eulogized some forty years before.|English
LJ004-0054|In order to give greater value to the pamphlet,|English
LJ004-0055|he personally visited several English jails, and pointed his observations by drawing forcible contrasts between the good and bad.|English
LJ004-0056|Mr. Buxton's small work on prison discipline gave a new aspect to the question he had so much at heart.|English
LJ004-0057|For the first time the doctrine was enunciated that prisoners had rights of their own.|English
LJ004-0058|The untried, and in the eyes of the law still innocent, could claim pure air, wholesome and sufficient food, and opportunities for exercise.|English
LJ004-0059|They had a right, Mr. Buxton affirmed, to be employed in their own crafts, provided it could be safely followed in prison.|English
LJ004-0060|"You have no right, he says, addressing the authorities, ""to subject a prisoner to suffering from cold,"|English
LJ004-0061|by want of bed-clothing by night or firing by day|English
LJ004-0062|and the reason is plain: you have taken him from his home, and have deprived him of the means of providing himself with the necessaries or comforts of life,|English
LJ004-0063|"and therefore you are bound to furnish him with moderate indeed but suitable accommodation."""|English
LJ004-0064|"You have for the same reason, he goes on, ""no right to ruin his habits by compelling him to be idle,"|English
LJ004-0065|his morals by compelling him to mix with a promiscuous assemblage of hardened and convicted criminals,|English
LJ004-0066|or his health by forcing him at night into a damp, unventilated cell, with such crowds of companions as very speedily render the air foul and putrid;|English
LJ004-0067|or to make him sleep in close contact with the victims of contagious and loathsome disease,|English
LJ004-0068|or amidst the noxious effluvia of dirt and corruption.|English
LJ004-0069|In short, attention to his feelings, mental and bodily, a supply of every necessary, abstraction from evil society,|English
LJ004-0070|"the conservation of his health and industrious habits, are the clear, evident, undeniable rights of an unconvicted prisoner."""|English
LJ004-0071|Nor even when found guilty and his liberty forfeited did his privileges cease. The law appointed a suitable punishment for the offense;|English
LJ004-0072|it was for those charged with the administration of the law to guard carefully against any aggravation of that punishment,|English
LJ004-0073|"to see that ""no circumstances of severity are found in his treatment which are not found in his sentence."""|English
LJ004-0074|No judge ever condemned a man to be half-perished with cold by day, or half-suffocated with heat by night.|English
LJ004-0075|Who ever heard of a criminal being sentenced to catch the rheumatism or the typhus fever?|English
LJ004-0076||English
LJ004-0077|"nor has he a right to poison or starve his fellow-creatures."""|English
LJ004-0078|The convicted delinquent has his rights, said Mr. Buxton authoritatively.|English
LJ004-0079||English
LJ004-0080|because they are not specified in his sentence; he is therefore entitled to a wholesome atmosphere,|English
LJ004-0081|"decent clothing and bedding, and a diet sufficient to support him."""|English
LJ004-0082|These somewhat novel but undoubtedly indisputable propositions were backed up, not by sound arguments only, but by the letter of the law.|English
LJ004-0083|As Mr. Buxton pointed out, many old acts of parliament designed to protect the prisoner were still in full force.|English
LJ004-0084|Some might be in abeyance, but they had never been repealed, and some were quite freshly imported upon the Statute Book.|English
LJ004-0085|As far back as the reign of Charles the second, a law was passed declaring that sufficient provision should be made for the relief and setting on work|English
LJ004-0086|"of ""poor and needy prisoners committed to the common jail for felony and other misdemeanors, who many times perish before their trial;"|English
LJ004-0087|"and the poor there living idle and unemployed become debauched, and come forth instructed in the practice of thievery and lewdness."""|English
LJ004-0088|As a remedy, justices of the peace were empowered to provide materials for the setting of poor prisoners to work,|English
LJ004-0089|and to pay overseers or instructors out of the county rates.|English
LJ004-0090|"Again, the twenty-two Charles the second c twenty ordered the jailer to keep felons and debtors ""separate and apart from one another,"|English
LJ004-0091|"in distinct rooms, on pain of forfeiting his office and treble damages to the party aggrieved."""|English
LJ004-0092|A much later act, the fourteen George the third c. fifty-nine (seventeen seventy-four),|English
LJ004-0093|which was contemporaneous with Howard's first journeys, laid down precise rules as regards cleanliness, and the proper supply of space and air.|English
LJ004-0094|"This act set forth that ""whereas the malignant fever commonly called the jail distemper"|English
LJ004-0095|is found to be owing to want of cleanliness and fresh air in the several jails,|English
LJ004-0096|the fatal consequences whereof might be prevented if the justices of the peace were duly authorized|English
LJ004-0097|to provide such accommodations in jails as may be necessary to answer this salutary purpose,|English
LJ004-0098|"it is enacted that the justices shall order the walls of every room to be scraped and white-washed once every year."""|English
LJ004-0099|Ventilators, hand and others, were to be supplied.|English
LJ004-0100|An infirmary, consisting of two distinct rooms, one for males and one for females, should be provided for the separate accommodation of the sick.|English
LJ004-0101|"Warm and cold baths, or ""commodious bathing tubs,"""|English
LJ004-0102|were to be kept in every jail, and the prisoners directed to wash in them before release. These provisions were almost a dead letter.|English
LJ004-0103|Yet another act passed in seventeen ninety-one, if properly observed, should have insured proper attention to them.|English
LJ004-0104|By the thirty-one George the third c. forty-six, s. five,|English
LJ004-0105|two or more justices were appointed visitors of prisons, and directed to visit and inspect three times every quarter.|English
LJ004-0106|They were to report in writing to quarter sessions as to the state of the jail, and as to all abuses which they might observe therein.|English
LJ004-0107|The most important jail act of that early period, however, was the twenty-four George the third c. fifty-four, s. four (seventeen eighty-four)|English
LJ004-0108|which was the first legislative attempt to compel the classification of prisoners, or their separation into classes|English
LJ004-0109|according to their categories or crimes.|English
LJ004-0110|It was made incumbent upon the justices to provide distinct places of confinement for five classes of prisoners, viz.|English
LJ004-0111|one. Prisoners convicted of felony. two. Prisoners committed on a charge or suspicion of felony.|English
LJ004-0112|three. Prisoners guilty of misdemeanors. four. Prisoners charged with misdemeanors. five. Debtors.|English
LJ004-0113|It was further ordered that male prisoners should be kept perfectly distinct from the females.|English
LJ004-0114|King's evidences were also to be lodged apart.|English
LJ004-0115|Infirmaries separating the sexes were also to be provided, a chapel too, and warm and cold baths.|English
LJ004-0116|Care also was to be taken that the prisoners shall not be kept in any apartment underground.|English
LJ004-0117|In an early report of the Prison Discipline Improvement Society,|English
LJ004-0118|published some six-and-thirty years after the promulgation of this act, the flagrant and persistent violations of it and others|English
LJ004-0119|which had continued through that long period, are forcibly pointed out.|English
LJ004-0120|In eighteen eighteen, out of five hundred and eighteen prisons in the United Kingdom,|English
LJ004-0121|to which a total of upwards of one hundred thousand prisoners had been committed in the year, only twenty-three prisons were divided according to law;|English
LJ004-0122|fifty-nine had no division whatever to separate males and females; one hundred and thirty-six had only one division for the purpose;|English
LJ004-0123|sixty-eight had only two divisions, and so on.|English
LJ004-0124|In four hundred and forty-five prisons no work of any description had been introduced for the employment of prisoners;|English
LJ004-0125|in the balance some work was done, but with the most meager results.|English
LJ004-0126|The want of room was still a crying evil.|English
LJ004-0127|In one hundred jails,|English
LJ004-0128|capable of accommodating only eight thousand five hundred and forty-five persons, as many as thirteen thousand and fifty-seven were crowded.|English
LJ004-0129|Many of the jails were in the most deplorable condition:|English
LJ004-0130|incommodious, as has been stated, insecure, unhealthy, and unprovided with the printed or written regulations required by law.|English
LJ004-0131|To specify more particularly one or two of the worst, it may be mentioned that in the Borough Compter|English
LJ004-0132|the old evils of indiscriminate association still continued unchecked.|English
LJ004-0133|All prisoners passed their time in absolute idleness, or killed it by gambling and loose conversation.|English
LJ004-0134|The debtors were crowded almost inconceivably. In a space twenty feet long by six wide,|English
LJ004-0135|twenty men slept on eight straw beds, with sixteen rugs amongst them, and a piece of timber for a bolster.|English
LJ004-0136|Mr. Buxton, who found this, declared that it seemed physically impossible, but he was assured that it was true,|English
LJ004-0137|"and that it was accomplished by ""sleeping edgewise."""|English
LJ004-0138|One poor wretch, who had slept next the wall, said he had been literally unable to move for the pressure.|English
LJ004-0139|In the morning the stench and heat were so oppressive that he and every one else on waking rushed unclothed into the yard;|English
LJ004-0140|"and the turnkey told Mr. Buxton that the ""smell on first opening the door was enough to knock down a horse."|English
LJ004-0141|The hospital was filled with infectious cases, and in one room, seven feet by nine, with closed windows,|English
LJ004-0142|where a lad lay ill with fever, three other prisoners, at first perfectly healthy, were lodged. Of course they were seized with the fever;|English
LJ004-0143|so that the culprit, in addition to his sentence,|English
LJ004-0144|"had to endure by ""the regulations of the city a disease very dangerous in its nature,"" and ran the risk of a lingering and painful death."|English
LJ004-0145|At Guildford prison, which Mr. Buxton also visited in eighteen eighteen,|English
LJ004-0146|there was no infirmary, no chapel, no work, no classification.|English
LJ004-0147|The irons, which nearly every one wore, were remarkably heavy; those double ironed could not take off their small clothes.|English
LJ004-0148|No prison dress was allowed, and half the inmates were without shirts or shoes or stockings.|English
LJ004-0149|The diet was limited to dry bread, which was of the best certainly, and a pound and a half in weight.|English
LJ004-0150|Matters were on much the same footing at St. Albans.|English
LJ004-0151|They were far worse at Bristol,|English
LJ004-0152|although at Mr. Buxton's visit a new jail was in process of erection, the first step towards reform since Howard's visitation in seventeen seventy-four.|English
LJ004-0153|In eighteen eighteen the old jail was so densely packed that it was nearly impossible to pass through the yards for the throng.|English
LJ004-0154|One hundred and fifty were lodged in a prison just capable of holding fifty-two.|English
LJ004-0155|"In the crowd, all of them persons who had ""no other avocation or mode of livelihood but thieving,"" Mr. Buxton counted eleven children"|English
LJ004-0156|children hardly old enough to be released from the nursery.|English
LJ004-0157|All charged with felony were in heavy irons, without distinction of age.|English
LJ004-0158|All were in ill health; almost all were in rags; almost all were filthy in the extreme.|English
LJ004-0159|The state of the prison, the desperation of the prisoners, broadly hinted in their conversation and plainly expressed in their conduct,|English
LJ004-0160|the uproar of oaths, complaints, and obscenity,|English
LJ004-0161|the indescribable stench, presented together a concentration of the utmost misery and the utmost guilt.|English
LJ004-0162|"It was ""a scene of infernal passions and distresses,"" says Buxton, ""which few have imagination sufficient to picture,"|English
LJ004-0163|"and of which fewer still would believe that the original is to be found in this enlightened and happy country."""|English
LJ004-0164|There was still worse to come. Having explored the yards and adjacent day rooms, and sleeping cells, a door was unlocked,|English
LJ004-0165|the visitors were furnished with candles, and they descended eighteen long steps into a vault.|English
LJ004-0166|At the bottom was a circular space, through which ran a narrow passage, and the sides of which were fitted with barrack bedsteads.|English
LJ004-0167|The floor was on the level of the river, and very damp.|English
LJ004-0168|"The smell at one o'clock of the day ""was something more than can be expressed by the term disgusting."""|English
LJ004-0169|On the dirty bedstead lay a wretched being in the throes of severe illness.|English
LJ004-0170|"The only ventilation of this pit, this ""dark, cheerless, damp, unwholesome cavern -- a dungeon in its worst sense"""|English
LJ004-0171|was by a kind of chimney, which the prisoners kept hermetically sealed, and which had never been opened in the memory of the turnkey.|English
LJ004-0172|Untried persons were often lodged in this nauseous underground den,|English
LJ004-0173|"and sometimes slept in ""the pit,"" loaded with heavy irons for a whole year, waiting the jail delivery."|English
LJ004-0174|Confinement for twelve months in the Bristol jail was counted a punishment equivalent to seven years' transportation.|English
LJ004-0175|In this prison there was no female infirmary.|English
LJ004-0176|Sick women and their children remained in the ordinary wards, and propagated disease.|English
LJ004-0177|No prison dress was allowed; no reception-room was provided, no soap, towels, or baths.|English
LJ004-0178|"The bedclothes consisted only of a single ""very slight"" rug."|English
LJ004-0179|The allowance of food daily to felons was a fourpenny loaf,|English
LJ004-0180|a price which in those days fluctuated enormously -- as much as a hundred percent in a couple of years;|English
LJ004-0181|but as no similar variation occurred in the prisoner's appetite, his ration was somewhat precarious.|English
LJ004-0182|As for the debtors, they had no allowance whatever, and were often in imminent danger of starvation.|English
LJ004-0183|With all this, the inmates were crowded together at night to such a degree as to excite surprise that they should escape suffocation.|English
LJ004-0184|There reigned through the whole edifice a chilly, damp, unwholesome atmosphere, and the effluvia from the prisoners was so nauseous|English
LJ004-0185|that the chaplain found it necessary to take his place before they entered chapel, as he could not otherwise have faced the smell.|English
LJ004-0186|It is consoling to know that there were a few brilliant exceptions to this cruel, callous neglect.|English
LJ004-0187|Already, as early as eighteen eighteen, a prison existed at Bury St. Edmunds which was a model for imitation to others at that time,|English
LJ004-0188|and which even fulfilled many of the exacting requirements of modern days.|English
LJ004-0189|The great principles of classification, cleanliness, and employment were closely observed.|English
LJ004-0190|There were eighty-four separate sleeping-cells, and unless the jail was overcrowded, every inmate passed the night alone,|English
LJ004-0191|and in comparative comfort, with a bed and proper bedding.|English
LJ004-0192|The prison stood on a dry, airy situation outside the town.|English
LJ004-0193|Prisoners on reception were treated as they are now-a-days -- bathed, dressed in prison clothes, and inspected by the surgeon.|English
LJ004-0194|No irons were worn except as a punishment.|English
LJ004-0195|Personal cleanliness was insisted upon, and all parts of the prison were kept scrupulously clean.|English
LJ004-0196|There was an infirmary, properly found and duly looked after.|English
LJ004-0197|No idleness was permitted among the inmates. Trades were taught, or prisoners were allowed to follow their own if suitable.|English
LJ004-0198|There was, besides, a mill for grinding corn, somewhat similar to a turn-spit, which prisoners turned by walking in rows.|English
LJ004-0199|This made exertion compulsory, and imposed hard labor as a proper punishment.|English
LJ004-0200|Another jail, that of Ilchester, was also worthy of all commendation. It exhibited all the good points of that at Bury.|English
LJ004-0201|At Ilchester the rule of employment had been carried further.|English
LJ004-0202|A system not adopted generally till nearly half a century later had already prevailed at Ilchester.|English
LJ004-0203|The new jail had been in a great measure constructed by the prisoners themselves.|English
LJ004-0204|Masons, bricklayers, carpenters, painters had been employed upon the buildings, and the work was pronounced excellent by competent judges.|English
LJ004-0205|Industrial labor had also been introduced with satisfactory results.|English
LJ004-0206|Blanket weaving and cloth spinning was carried on prosperously,|English
LJ004-0207|and all the material for prisoners' apparel was manufactured in the jail.|English
LJ004-0208|There were work-rooms for wool-washing, dyeing, carding, and spinning.|English
LJ004-0209|The looms were constantly busy. Tailors were always at work, and every article of clothing and bedding was made up within the walls.|English
LJ004-0210|There was a prison laundry too, where all the prisoners' linen was regularly washed.|English
LJ004-0211|The moral welfare of the inmates was as closely looked after as the physical.|English
LJ004-0212|There was an attentive chaplain, a schoolmaster, and regular religious and other instruction.|English
LJ004-0213|Compared with those highly meritorious institutions Newgate still showed but badly.|English
LJ004-0214|Its evils were inherent and irremediable, but some ameliorating measures had been introduced,|English
LJ004-0215|mainly through the exertions of a new governor, Mr. Brown, who succeeded Mr. Newman at Newgate in eighteen seventeen.|English
LJ004-0216|The most noticeable of the improvements introduced was a better regulation of dietaries within the prison.|English
LJ004-0217|The old haphazard system, by which meat was issued in bulk,|English
LJ004-0218|a week's allowance at a time, was abolished, and there was a regular scale of daily rations adopted.|English
LJ004-0219|The diet was now ample. It consisted of a pound and a half of bread per diem;|English
LJ004-0220|for breakfast a pint of gruel; for dinner half a pound of boiled meat, or a quart of soup with vegetables, on alternate days.|English
LJ004-0221|The food was properly prepared in the prison kitchen.|English
LJ004-0222|Meat was no longer issued raw, to be imperfectly cooked before a ward fire and bolted gluttonously, the whole two pounds at one sitting.|English
LJ004-0223|Mr. Brown confidently asserted that no jail in England now fed its inmates so well as did Newgate.|English
LJ004-0224|So plentiful was this dietary, that although the old permission remained in force of allowing the friends of prisoners to bring them supplies from outside,|English
LJ004-0225|the practice was falling into abeyance, and the prisoners seldom required private assistance to eke out their meals.|English
LJ004-0226|It was also claimed for the more ample and more orderly distribution of victuals, that the general health of the prisoners had greatly improved.|English
LJ004-0227|Mr. Brown also, much to his own credit, brought about the abandonment of the practice of ironing all prisoners as a matter of course.|English
LJ004-0228|In eighteen eighteen prisoners awaiting trial in Newgate, were at length relieved from this illegal infliction.|English
LJ004-0229|Convicts were not even compelled to wear irons, providing they behaved well.|English
LJ004-0230|It was found that shackles might be safely dispensed with, even in the case of the most desperate characters.|English
LJ004-0231|This was effected by stopping the nearly indiscriminate admission of visitors, which had hitherto prevailed all over the jail.|English
LJ004-0232|Ironing it will be remembered, was a distinguishing badge, so that when the jail was cleared the free might be readily known from the captive, and escapes prevented.|English
LJ004-0233|Under the new rule visitors were not allowed to pass into the interior of the prison, but were detained between the grating.|English
LJ004-0234|This change led to some discontent, until it was found that the much greater boon of relief from irons accompanied it, and the reform was quietly accepted.|English
LJ004-0235|Indeed the best consequences followed from the removal of irons. The prisoners were much better disposed; there were no riots, and fewer disturbances.|English
LJ004-0236|But nothing short of radical reform and complete reconstruction could touch the deep-seated evils of association, overcrowding, and idleness.|English
LJ004-0237|The first still produced deplorable results -- results to be observable for many years to come.|English
LJ004-0238|Mr. Buxton mentions the case of a boy whose apparent innocence and artlessness had attracted his attention.|English
LJ004-0239|He had been committed for an offense for which he was acquitted.|English
LJ004-0240|He left Newgate utterly corrupted, and after lapsing into crime, soon returned with a very different character.|English
LJ004-0241|Other cases of moral deterioration have already been recorded.|English
LJ004-0242|Some attempt was made to reduce the overcrowding, on the recommendation of the House of Commons Committee of eighteen eighteen, but this applied only a partial remedy.|English
LJ004-0243|The bulk of the prisoners were still left in idleness.|English
LJ004-0244|A few fortunate criminals, many of them kept back from transportation on purpose, who were skilled in trades, were employed at them.|English
LJ004-0245|Painters, plasterers, and carpenters were allowed to follow their handicrafts, with the reward of sixpence per diem and a double allowance of food.|English
LJ004-0246|They used their own tools, and this without any dangerous consequences as regards facilitating the escape of others,|English
LJ004-0247|thus disposing of the objection so long raised against the industrial employment of prisoners in Newgate.|English
LJ004-0248|But this boon of toil was denied to all but a very limited number.|English
LJ004-0249|As the Prison Discipline Society pertinently observed in a report dated eighteen twenty,|English
LJ004-0250||English
LJ005-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section eight: The beginnings of prison reform.|English
LJ005-0002|Newgate prisoners were the victims to another most objectionable practice which obtained all over London.|English
LJ005-0003|Persons committed to a metropolitan jail at that time were taken in gangs, men and women handcuffed together, or linked on to a long chain,|English
LJ005-0004|unless they could afford to pay for a vehicle out of their own funds.|English
LJ005-0005|Even then they were not certain of the favor, for I find a reference to a decent and respectable woman sent to Newgate|English
LJ005-0006|who handed a shilling to the escort warder to provide her with a hackney coach; but this functionary pocketed the cash, and obliged the woman to walk|English
LJ005-0007|chained to the rest. As the miserable crew filed through the public streets, exposed to the scornful gaze of every passenger,|English
LJ005-0008|they were followed by a crowd of reckless boys, who jeered at and insulted them.|English
LJ005-0009|Many thus led in procession were in a shocking condition of dirt and misery, frequently nearly naked, and often bearing upon them|English
LJ005-0010|"the germs, more or less developed, of contagious disease. ""Caravans,"" the forerunners of the prison vans,"|English
LJ005-0011|were first made use of about eighteen twenty-seven. That the need for prison reform was imperative may be gathered from the few out of many instances I have adduced,|English
LJ005-0012|yet there were those who, wedded to ancient ideas, were intolerant of change; they would not admit the existence of any evils.|English
LJ005-0013|One smug alderman, a member of the House of Commons, sneered at the ultra philanthropy of the champions of prison improvement.|English
LJ005-0014|Speaking on a debate on prison matters, he declared that|English
LJ005-0015|our prisoners have all that prisoners ought to have, without gentlemen think they ought to be indulged with Turkey carpets.|English
LJ005-0016|The Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline was taxed with a desire to introduce a system|English
LJ005-0017|tending to divest punishment of its just and salutary terrors;|English
LJ005-0018|an imputation which the Society indignantly and very justly repudiated, the statement being, as they said,|English
LJ005-0019|refuted by abundant evidence, and having no foundation whatever in truth.|English
LJ005-0020|Among those whom the Society found arrayed against it was Sydney Smith,|English
LJ005-0021|who, in a caustic article contributed to the 'Edinburgh Review,' protested against the pampering of criminals|English
LJ005-0022|While fully admitting the good intentions of the Society, he condemned their ultra humanitarianism as misplaced.|English
LJ005-0023|He took exception to various of the proposals of the Society. He thought they leant too much to a system of indulgence and education in jails.|English
LJ005-0024|He objected to the instruction of prisoners in reading and writing.|English
LJ005-0025|"A poor man who is lucky enough, he said, ""to have his son committed for a felony"|English
LJ005-0026|"educates him under such a system for nothing, while the virtuous simpleton who is on the other side of the wall is paying by the quarter for these attainments."""|English
LJ005-0027|He was altogether against too liberal a diet; he disapproved of industrial occupations in jails, as not calculated to render prisons terrible.|English
LJ005-0028||English
LJ005-0029|"nothing but beating hemp and pulling oakum and pounding bricks -- no work but what was tedious, unusual."""|English
LJ005-0030||English
LJ005-0031|no visiting of friends, no education but religious education, no freedom of diet,|English
LJ005-0032|no weavers' looms or carpenters' benches. There must be a great deal of solitude, coarse food, a dress of shame,|English
LJ005-0033|hard, incessant, irksome, eternal labor, a planned and regulated and unrelenting exclusion of happiness and comfort.|English
LJ005-0034|Undeterred by these sarcasms and misrepresentations,|English
LJ005-0035|the Society pursued its laudable undertaking with remarkable energy and great singleness of purpose.|English
LJ005-0036|The objects it had in view were set forth in one of its earliest meetings.|English
LJ005-0037|It sought to obtain and diffuse useful information|English
LJ005-0038|to suggest beneficial regulations, and circulate tracts demonstrating the advantages of classification,|English
LJ005-0039|constant inspection, regular employment, and humane treatment generally, with religious and moral instruction.|English
LJ005-0040|It earnestly advocated the appointment of female officers to take exclusive charge of female prisoners,|English
LJ005-0041|a much-needed and, according to our ideas, indispensable reform, already initiated by the Ladies' Committee at Newgate.|English
LJ005-0042|It made the subject of the newly-invented tread-wheels, or stepping-wheels, as they were at first called, its peculiar affair,|English
LJ005-0043|and obtained full details, from places where they had been adopted, of the nature of these new machines|English
LJ005-0044|the method by which they were worked, and the dietaries of the prisoners employed upon them.|English
LJ005-0045|Nor did it confine itself to mere verbal recommendations.|English
LJ005-0046|The good it tried to do took active shape in the establishment of temporary refuges -- at Hoxton for males, and in the Hackney Road for females|English
LJ005-0047|for the reception of deserving cases discharged from prison. The governor of Newgate and other metropolitan prisons had orders of admission to this refuge|English
LJ005-0048|which he could bestow on prisoners on release, and so save the better-disposed or the completely destitute from lapsing at once into crime.|English
LJ005-0049|The refuge, which had for its object the training of its inmates in habits of industry,|English
LJ005-0050|and in moral and religious duty, and which after a time sought to provide them with suitable situations, was supported entirely out of the funds of the Society.|English
LJ005-0051|At the time of its greatest prosperity, its annual income from donations and subscriptions was about one thousand six hundred pounds.|English
LJ005-0052|Another point to which the Society devoted infinite pains was the preparation of plans for the guidance of architects in the construction of prisons.|English
LJ005-0053|A very valuable volume published by the Society|English
LJ005-0054|traced the progress of prison architecture from the days when the jail was the mere annexe of the baronial or episcopal castle|English
LJ005-0055|or a dungeon above or below the gate of a town, to the first attempts at systematic reconstruction carried out under the advice and supervision of Howard.|English
LJ005-0056|"It is interesting to observe that the plan of ""radiation,"" by which the prison blocks radiated from a central hall, like spokes in a wheel"|English
LJ005-0057|was introduced as early as seventeen ninety by Mr. Blackburn|English
LJ005-0058|an architect of eminence who was very largely employed in the erection of prison buildings at the close of the last century.|English
LJ005-0059|With some important modifications this principle of radiation is still the rule.|English
LJ005-0060|The Society did not limit its remarks to the description of what had already been done|English
LJ005-0061|but it offered suggestions for future buildings, with numerous carefully-executed drawings and designs of the model it recommended for imitation.|English
LJ005-0062|Experience has since shown that in some respects these plans are defective, especially in the placing of the governor's residence in the center of the prison.|English
LJ005-0063|It was thought that this would guarantee constant supervision and inspection, but it did nothing of the kind, and only the presence of warders on duty|English
LJ005-0064|is found now-a-days to be really efficacious. The main recommendations, however, are based upon common sense|English
LJ005-0065|and none are more commendable than that which deprecates the excessive ornamentation of the external parts of the edifice.|English
LJ005-0066|"The new jails, as Howard says, ""having pompous fronts, appear like palaces to the lower class of people, and many persons are against them on this account."""|English
LJ005-0067|The Prison Society reproves the misdirected efforts of ambitious architects, who by a lavish and improvident expenditure of public money|English
LJ005-0068|"sought to ""rank the prisons they built among the most splendid buildings of the city or town."""|English
LJ005-0069|Absence of embellishment is in perfect unison with the character of the establishment.|English
LJ005-0070|These are principles fully recognized now-a-days, and it may fairly be conceded that the Prison Discipline Society's ideal|English
LJ005-0071|differed little from that kept in view in the construction of the latest and best modern jails.|English
LJ005-0072|After a few years of active exertion the Society was rewarded by fresh legislation.|English
LJ005-0073|To its efforts, and their effect upon Parliament and the public mind, we must attribute the new Jail Acts of four George the fourth|English
LJ005-0074|cap. sixty-four, and five George the fourth cap. eighty-five|English
LJ005-0075|which having gone through several sessions, at last became law in eighteen twenty-three to four|English
LJ005-0076|By the preamble of the first-named act it was declared|English
LJ005-0077||English
LJ005-0078|but shall also tend more effectually to preserve the health|English
LJ005-0079|and improve the morals of the prisoners, and shall insure the proper measure of punishment to convicted offenders.|English
LJ005-0080|Accordingly due provision was made for the enforcement of hard labor on all prisoners sentenced to it, and for the employment of all others.|English
LJ005-0082|unless such ability (to work) should cease by reason of sickness, infirmity, the want of sufficient work, or from any other cause.|English
LJ005-0083|It was distinctly laid down that male and female prisoners should be confined in separate buildings or parts of the prison,|English
LJ005-0084|so as to prevent them from seeing, conversing, or holding any intercourse with each other.|English
LJ005-0085|Classification was insisted upon, in the manner laid down by the twenty-four George the third cap. fifty-four,|English
LJ005-0086|with such further separation as the justices should deem conducive to good order and discipline.|English
LJ005-0087|Female prisoners were in all cases to be under the charge of female officers.|English
LJ005-0088|Every prison containing female prisoners was to have a matron who was to reside constantly in the prison.|English
LJ005-0089|The religious and moral welfare of the prisoners were to be attended to,|English
LJ005-0090|the first by daily services, the latter by the appointment of schoolmasters and instruction in reading and writing.|English
LJ005-0091|"Last, but not least, the use of irons was strictly forbidden, ""except in cases of urgent and absolute necessity,"""|English
LJ005-0092|and every prisoner was to be provided with a hammock or cot to himself, suitable bedding, and, if possible, a separate cell.|English
LJ005-0093|The second act, passed in the following year, enlarged and amended the first, and at the same time gave powers to the House|English
LJ005-0094|to call for information as to the observance of its provisions.|English
LJ005-0095|The promulgation of these two Jail Acts strengthened the hands of the Prison Discipline Society enormously.|English
LJ005-0096|It had now a legal and authoritative standard of efficiency to apply,|English
LJ005-0097|and could expose all the local authorities that still lagged behind, or neglected to comply with the provisions of the new laws.|English
LJ005-0098|The Society did not shrink from its self-imposed duty, but continued year after year, with unflagging energy and unflinching spirit, to watch closely|English
LJ005-0099|and report at length upon the condition of the prisons of the country.|English
LJ005-0100|For this purpose it kept up an extensive correspondence with all parts of the kingdom, and circulated queries to be answered in detail,|English
LJ005-0101|whence it deduced the practice and condition of every prison that replied.|English
LJ005-0102|Upon these and the private visitations made by various members the Society obtained the facts,|English
LJ005-0103|often highly damnatory, which were embodied in its annual reports.|English
LJ005-0104|The progress of improvement was certainly extremely slow.|English
LJ005-0105|It was long before the many jurisdictions imitated the few.|English
LJ005-0106|Jails, of which the old prison at Reading was a specimen, were still left intact.|English
LJ005-0107|In that prison, with its cells and yards arranged within the shell of an ancient abbey chapel,|English
LJ005-0108|"the prisoners, without firing, bedding, or sufficient food, spent their days ""in surveying their grotesque prison,"|English
LJ005-0109|or contriving some means of escape by climbing the fluted columns which supported the Gothic arches of the aisles,|English
LJ005-0110|and so passing by the roof down into the garden and on to freedom.|English
LJ005-0111|In a county prison adjoining the metropolis, the separation between the male and female quarters was supposed to be accomplished by the erection of an iron railing;|English
LJ005-0112|in this same prison capital convicts were chained to the floor until execution.|English
LJ005-0113|In another jail not far off male and female felons still occupied the same room -- underground, and reached by a ladder of ten steps.|English
LJ005-0114|In others the separation between the sexes consisted in a hanging curtain|English
LJ005-0115|or an imaginary boundary line, and nothing prevented parties from passing to either side|English
LJ005-0116|but an empty regulation which all so disposed could defy.|English
LJ005-0117|Numbers of the jails were still unprovided with chaplains, and the prisoners never heard Divine service.|English
LJ005-0118|In many others there were no infirmaries, no places set apart for the confinement of prisoners afflicted with dangerous and infectious disorders.|English
LJ005-0119|No attempt was made to maintain discipline.|English
LJ005-0120|Half the jails had no code of rules properly prepared and sanctioned by the judges, according to law.|English
LJ005-0121|By degrees, however,|English
LJ005-0122|the changes necessary to bring the prisons into conformity with the recent acts were attempted, if not actually introduced into the county prisons, to which,|English
LJ005-0123|with a few of the more important city or borough prisons, these acts more especially applied.|English
LJ005-0124|Most of the local authorities embarked into considerable expenditure, determined to rebuild their jails de novo on the most approved pattern,|English
LJ005-0125|or to reappropriate, reconstruct, and patch up the existing prisons till they were more in accordance with the growing requirements of the times.|English
LJ005-0126|Religious worship became more generally the rule; chaplains were appointed, and chapels provided for them; surgeons and hospitals also.|English
LJ005-0127|Workshops were built at many prisons, various kinds of manufactures and trades were set on foot, including weaving, matting, shoe-making, and tailoring.|English
LJ005-0128|The interior of one prison was illuminated throughout with gas, -- still a novelty, which had been generally adopted in London only four years previously,|English
LJ005-0129|a measure which must greatly tend to discourage attempts to escape.|English
LJ005-0130|There were tread-wheels at most of the prisons, and regular employment thereon or at some other kind of hard labor.|English
LJ005-0131|In many places too where the prisoners earned money by their work, they were granted a portion of it for their own use after proper deduction for maintenance.|English
LJ005-0132|Only a few glaring evils still demanded a remedy.|English
LJ005-0133|The provision of separate sleeping cells was still quite inadequate. For instance,|English
LJ005-0134|in twenty-two county jails there were one thousand sixty-three sleeping cells in all (in eighteen twenty-three)|English
LJ005-0135|and the average daily number committed that year amounted to three thousand, nine hundred eighty-five.|English
LJ005-0136|The want of sleeping cells long continued a crying need.|English
LJ005-0137|Four years later the Prison Society reported|English
LJ005-0138|that in four prisons, which at one time of the year contained one thousand three hundred eight prisoners, there were only sixty-eight sleeping rooms or cells,|English
LJ005-0139|making an average of nineteen persons occupying each room.|English
LJ005-0140|At the New Prison, Clerkenwell, which had become the principal reception jail of Middlesex, and so took all the untried,|English
LJ005-0141|the sleeping space per head was only sixteen inches, and often as many as two hundred ninety-three men had to be accommodated on barrack beds|English
LJ005-0142|occupying barely three hundred ninety feet lineal|English
LJ005-0143|"The ""scenes of tumult and obscenity"" in these night rooms are said to have been beyond description; a prisoner in one nocturnal riot lost an eye."|English
LJ005-0144|Yet to Clerkenwell were now committed the juveniles, and all who were inexperienced in crime.|English
LJ005-0145|Great want of uniformity in treatment in the various prisons was still noticeable|English
LJ005-0146|and was indeed destined to continue for another half century, in other words, until the introduction of the Prison Act of eighteen seventy-seven.|English
LJ005-0147|At the time of which I am writing there was great diversity of practice as regards the hours of labor.|English
LJ005-0148|In some prisons the prisoners worked seven hours a day, in others ten and ten and a half.|English
LJ005-0149|The nature of the employment varied greatly in severity, especially the tread-wheel labor.|English
LJ005-0150|In some county jails, as I have already said, female prisoners were placed upon the tread-wheel;|English
LJ005-0151|in others women were very properly exempted from it, and also from all severe labor.|English
LJ005-0152|Earnings were very differently appropriated. Here the prisoners were given the whole amount, there a half or a third.|English
LJ005-0153|Sometimes this money might be expended in the purchase of extra articles of food.|English
LJ005-0154|The rations varied considerably everywhere.|English
LJ005-0155|It was still limited to bread in some places, the allowance of which varied from one to three pounds;|English
LJ005-0156|in others meat, soup, gruel, beer were given.|English
LJ005-0157|Here and there food was not issued in kind, but a money allowance which the prisoner might expend himself.|English
LJ005-0158|Bedding and clothing was still denied, but only in a few jails;|English
LJ005-0159|in others both were supplied in ample quantities, the cost varying per prisoner from twenty shillings to five pounds.|English
LJ005-0160|It was plain that although the law had defined general principles of prison government,|English
LJ005-0161|too much discretion was still left to the magistracy to fill in the details. The legislature only recommended,|English
LJ005-0162|it did not peremptorily insist. Too often the letter of the law was observed, but not its spirit.|English
LJ005-0163|One great impediment to wide amelioration was that a vast number of small jails lay out of reach of the law.|English
LJ005-0164|When the new acts were introduced, numerous prisons under local jurisdiction were exempted from the operation of the law.|English
LJ005-0165|They were so radically bad that reform seemed hopeless, and it was thought wiser not to bring them under provisions which clearly could not be enforced.|English
LJ005-0166|Mr. Peel, who as Home Secretary had charge of the bill,|English
LJ005-0167|"which became the four George the fourth cap. sixty-four, said that he had abstained from legislating for these small jurisdictions ""on mature deliberation."""|English
LJ005-0168|"It is not, he said, ""that I am insensible of the lamentable and disgraceful situation in which many of them are,"|English
LJ005-0169|but I indulge a hope that many of them will contract with the counties,|English
LJ005-0170|that many of them will build new jails, and that when in a year or two we come to examine their situation,|English
LJ005-0171|we shall find but few which have not in one or other of these ways removed the grievance of which such just complaint is made.|English
LJ005-0172|When that time arrives|English
LJ005-0173|I shall not hesitate to ask Parliament for powers to compel them to make the necessary alterations, for it is not to be endured that these local jurisdictions should remain|English
LJ005-0174|"in the deplorable situation in which many of them now are."""|English
LJ005-0175|At this time there were in England one hundred and seventy boroughs, cities, towns, and liberties|English
LJ005-0176|which possessed the right of trying criminals for various offenses.|English
LJ005-0177|Nearly every one of these jurisdictions had its own prison, and there were one hundred and sixty such jails in all.|English
LJ005-0178|Many of them consisted of one or two rooms at most.|English
LJ005-0179|he total number of prisoners they received during the year varied from two persons to many hundreds.|English
LJ005-0180|It was in these jails, withdrawn from the pressure of authority, that the new rules were invariably ignored.|English
LJ005-0181|"The right and privilege of the borough to maintain its own place of confinement was so ""ancient and indisputable,"""|English
LJ005-0182|that for long no idea of interfering with them was entertained.|English
LJ005-0183|All that was urged was that the borough magistracy had no right to govern their jails|English
LJ005-0184|"so as to corrupt those committed, ""to the injury of the peace and morals of the public."""|English
LJ005-0185|As time passed, however, these magistrates made no effort at reform.|English
LJ005-0186|They neither built new jails nor contracted with the counties, as had been expected, for the transfer of their prisoners.|English
LJ005-0187|"As the Society put it in eighteen twenty-seven, ""the friends to the improvement of prison discipline will regret to learn"|English
LJ005-0188|that the jails attached to corporate jurisdictions continue to be the fruitful sources|English
LJ005-0189|of vice and misery, debasing all who are confined within their walls, and disseminating through their respective communities|English
LJ005-0190|the knowledge and practice of every species of criminality.|English
LJ005-0191|The Society proceeded to support this indictment by facts. It is much the old story.|English
LJ005-0192|The prisoners were lodged in rooms whence they could converse with passengers in the streets, and freely obtain spirits and other prohibited articles.|English
LJ005-0193|All descriptions of offenders congregated together in the felons' wards.|English
LJ005-0194|The keeper and his officers resided at a distance from the jail, and left its inmates to their own devices.|English
LJ005-0195|There was no decency whatever in the internal arrangements;|English
LJ005-0196|still no separation of the sexes, no means of ablution or other necessary services.|English
LJ005-0197|One borough prison consisted of nothing more than a couple of cells, about ten yards square, and absolutely nothing more.|English
LJ005-0198|In another borough, with a population of ten thousand, the prison was of the same dimensions.|English
LJ005-0199|"One cell was a dungeon, and the other an ""improper and unhealthy abode for any human being,"" with a watercourse running through it."|English
LJ005-0200|Most of these small jails were still in existence and in much the same state eight years later,|English
LJ005-0201|as is shown by the report of the Commissioners to inquire into the state of the municipal corporations in eighteen thirty-five.|English
LJ005-0202|An examination of this report shows how even the most insignificant township had its jail.|English
LJ005-0203|"Thus Dinas Mwddy, in Merionethshire, had, ""besides the pinfold and the stocks or crib, a little prison."""|English
LJ005-0204|Clun, in Shropshire, had a lock-up under the town hall.|English
LJ005-0205|At Eye, in Suffolk, the jail was part of the poor-house; so it was at Richmond, in Yorkshire, where the master of the workhouse was also keeper of the jail.|English
LJ005-0206|At Godmanchester there was no jail, but a cage to secure prisoners till they could be taken before a magistrate.|English
LJ005-0207|Kidderminster had a prison, one damp chill room,|English
LJ005-0208|the only aperture through which air could be admitted being an iron grating level with the street,|English
LJ005-0209|through the bars of which quills or reeds were inserted, and drink conveyed to the prisoners.|English
LJ005-0210|At Walsall, in Staffordshire,|English
LJ005-0211|the jail consisted of six cells, frequently so damp that the moisture trickled down the walls; there was not space for air or exercise,|English
LJ005-0212|and the prison allowance was still limited to bread and water.|English
LJ005-0213|Newgate through all these years continued a bye-word with the Society.|English
LJ005-0214|Some reforms had certainly been introduced, such as the abolition of irons, already referred to, and the establishment of male and female infirmaries.|English
LJ005-0215|The regular daily visitation of the chaplain was also insisted upon.|English
LJ005-0216|But it was pointed out in eighteen twenty-three that defective construction must always bar the way to any radical improvement in Newgate.|English
LJ005-0217|Without enlargement no material change in discipline or interior economy could possibly be introduced.|English
LJ005-0218|The chapel still continued incommodious and insufficient|English
LJ005-0219|female prisoners were still exposed to the full view of the males, the netting in front of the gallery being perfectly useless as a screen.|English
LJ005-0220|In eighteen twenty-four Newgate had no glass in its windows, except in the infirmary and one ward of the chapel yard;|English
LJ005-0221|and the panes were filled in with oiled paper, an insufficient protection against the weather;|English
LJ005-0222|and as the window-frames would not shut tight, the prisoners complained much of the cold, especially at night.|English
LJ005-0223|There was a diminution in the numbers in custody, due to the adoption of the practice of not committing at once to Newgate every offender for trial at the Old Bailey|English
LJ005-0224|but nothing had been done to improve the prison buildings.|English
LJ005-0225|"In eighteen twenty-seven the Society was compelled to report that ""no material change had taken place in Newgate since the passing of the prison laws,"|English
LJ005-0226|and that consequently the observance of their most important provisions was habitually neglected.|English
LJ005-0227|It was enacted that the court of aldermen should make rules for the government of the prison, and that these should be posted publicly within the walls.|English
LJ005-0228|As yet no rules or regulations had been printed or prepared.|English
LJ005-0229|"By another clause of the Jail Act, two justices were to be appointed to visit the prison at least thrice in every quarter, and ""oftener if occasion required."""|English
LJ005-0230|These justices were to inspect every part of the prison, and examine into the state and condition of prisoners.|English
LJ005-0231|The city justices had not fulfilled this obligation.|English
LJ005-0232|Idleness was still the general rule for all prisoners in Newgate, in defiance of the law.|English
LJ005-0233|There was no instruction of adult prisoners, in accordance with the law. The sleeping accommodation was still altogether contrary to the latest ideas.|English
LJ005-0234|The visits of friends was once more unreservedly allowed, and these incomers freely brought in extra provisions and beer.|English
LJ005-0235|Last, and worst of all, the arrangements for keeping the condemned prisoners between sentence and execution were more than unsatisfactory.|English
LJ005-0236|They were not confined apart from each other, but were crowded thirty or forty together in the press yard,|English
LJ005-0237|"so that ""corrupt conversation obliterated from the mind of him who is doomed to suffer every serious feeling and valuable impression."""|English
LJ005-0238|I shall have more to say on this subject, and upon the state of Newgate generally, in the following chapter.|English
LJ005-0239|The Prison Society did not relax its efforts as time passed, but its leading members had other and more pressing claims upon their energies.|English
LJ005-0240|Mr. Buxton had succeeded to the great work which William Wilberforce had commenced, and led the repeated attacks upon slavery in British colonies|English
LJ005-0241|till the whole body of the slaves were manumitted in eighteen thirty-three.|English
LJ005-0242|In the year immediately preceding this, Parliament was too busy with the great question of its own reform to spare much time for domestic legislation.|English
LJ005-0243|Nevertheless a committee of the House of Commons was appointed in eighteen thirty-one to report upon the whole system of secondary punishments,|English
LJ005-0244|which dealt with jails of all classes, as well as transportation.|English
LJ005-0245|This committee animadverted strongly upon the system in force at the metropolitan jails, and more especially upon the condition of Newgate|English
LJ005-0246|"where ""prisoners before and after trial are under no efficient superintendence,"" and where ""there was no restraint, or attempt at restraint."""|English
LJ005-0247|Mr. Samuel Hoare was examined by this committee|English
LJ005-0248|and stated that in his opinion Newgate, as the common jail of Middlesex, was wholly inadequate to the proper confinement of its prisoners.|English
LJ005-0249|From the moment of a person's committal he was certain to be plunged deeper and deeper in guilt.|English
LJ005-0250|The prisoners were crowded together in the jail, contrary to the requirements of the four George the fourth|English
LJ005-0251|Again in eighteen thirty-five prisons and their inmates became once more the care of the senate, and the subject was taken up this time by the House of Lords.|English
LJ005-0252|A committee was appointed, under the presidency of the Duke of Richmond|English
LJ005-0253||English
LJ005-0254|"upon the rules and discipline therein established with regard to the treatment of unconvicted as well as convicted persons."""|English
LJ005-0255|The committee was also to report upon the manner in which sentences were carried out, and to recommend any alterations necessary in the rules|English
LJ005-0256|in order to insure uniformity of discipline. It met on the thirty-first March, eighteen thirty-five, and continued its sittings well into July|English
LJ005-0257|during which time a host of witnesses were examined, and the committee presented three separate reports,|English
LJ005-0258|embodying recommendations which may be said to have formed the basis of modern prison management.|English
LJ005-0259|It was laid down as a first and indispensable principle that uniformity of discipline should prevail everywhere,|English
LJ005-0260|a theory which did not become a practical fact for forty more years.|English
LJ005-0261|As a means of securing this uniformity,|English
LJ005-0262|it was suggested that the rules framed for prison government should be subjected to the Secretary of State for approval,|English
LJ005-0263|and not, as heretofore, to the judges of assize; that, both to check abuses and watch the progress of improvement,|English
LJ005-0264|inspectors of prisons should be appointed, who should visit all the prisons from time to time and report to the Secretary of State.|English
LJ005-0265|It was recommended that the dietaries should be submitted and approved like the rules; that convicted prisoners should not receive any food but the jail allowance;|English
LJ005-0266|that food and fuel should be issued in kind, and never provided by the prisoners themselves out of monies granted them.|English
LJ005-0267|The use of tobacco, hitherto pretty generally indulged in both by men and women,|English
LJ005-0268|"should be strictly prohibited, ""as a stimulating luxury inconsistent with any notion of strict discipline and the due pressure of just punishment."""|English
LJ005-0269|Prison officers should not have any share in prisoners' earnings,|English
LJ005-0270|which should be paid into general prison funds, and no part of them handed over to the prisoners themselves.|English
LJ005-0271|As a means of increasing the severity of imprisonment, letters and visits from outside should not be permitted during the first six months of an imprisonment.|English
LJ005-0272|Various other recommendations were made as regards the appointment of chaplain and schoolmasters; the limitation of the powers of wardsmen,|English
LJ005-0273|or prisoners employed in positions of trust, who should not be permitted to traffic with their fellow-prisoners in any way.|English
LJ005-0274|The committee most of all insisted upon the entire individual separation of prisoners, except during the hours of labor,|English
LJ005-0275|"religious worship, and instruction, as ""absolutely necessary for preventing contamination,"|English
LJ005-0276|and for securing a proper system of prison discipline.|English
LJ005-0277|This was the first enunciation of the system of separate confinement,|English
LJ005-0278|which was eventually to replace the attempted arrangement of prisoners by classes according to antecedents and crimes,|English
LJ005-0279|an incomplete and fallacious method of preventing contamination.|English
LJ005-0280|The Lords' Committee fully recognized the painful fact|English
LJ005-0281|that the greatest mischief followed from the intercourse which was still permitted in so many prisons; to use its words,|English
LJ005-0282||English
LJ005-0283|and the tendency to crime in offenders not entirely hardened is confirmed by the language, the suggestions, and the example|English
LJ005-0284|of more depraved and systematic criminals.|English
LJ005-0285|This committee, as well as the one preceding it, also reported in terms of strong reprobation on the small prisons and jails|English
LJ005-0286|still under the borough corporations. The Commons' Committee gave it as their opinion that they were in a deplorable state.|English
LJ005-0287|The same language was used by the commissioners appointed to inquire into the municipal corporations in eighteen thirty-five,|English
LJ005-0288|when speaking more particularly of the borough jails.|English
LJ005-0289|"In these the commissioners found ""additional proof of the evils of continuing the present constitution of the local tribunals."|English
LJ005-0290|Instances rarely occur in which the borough jails admit of any proper classification of the prisoners.|English
LJ005-0291|In some large towns, as at Berwick on Tweed, Southampton, and Southwark, they (the prisons) are in a very discreditable condition.|English
LJ005-0292|In many of the smaller boroughs they are totally unfit for the confinement of human beings.|English
LJ005-0293|In these places the prisoners are often without a proper supply of air and light; frequently the jails are mere dungeons under the town hall.|English
LJ005-0294|It was frequently stated in evidence that the jail of the borough was in so unfit a state for the reception of prisoners,|English
LJ005-0295|"that plaintiffs were unwilling to consign the defendants against whom they had obtained execution to confinement within its walls."""|English
LJ005-0296|The Lords' Committee on Jails were of the same opinion, and considered the prisons under corporate or peculiar jurisdiction in a very unsatisfactory condition.|English
LJ005-0297|They therefore recommended that the prisoners should be removed|English
LJ005-0298|to the county jails from such prisons as were past improvement, and that the borough funds should be charged for the accommodation.|English
LJ005-0299|The whole question was again dealt with in Lord John Russell's bill for the reform of the municipal corporations, and with a more liberal election of town councilors,|English
LJ005-0300|and the establishment of municipal institutions upon a proper footing,|English
LJ006-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section nine: The first report of the inspector of prisons.|English
LJ006-0002|In the preceding chapter I have been tempted by the importance of the general question to give it prominence and precedence over the particular branch of which I am treating.|English
LJ006-0003|Newgate has remained rather in the background while the whole of the jails as a body were under discussion.|English
LJ006-0004|But this digression was necessary in order to present a more complete picture of the state of jails in the early part of the present century,|English
LJ006-0005|just before the public mind was first awakened to the need for thorough reform.|English
LJ006-0006|I shall now return to the great jail of the city of London, and give a more detailed account of its condition and inner life|English
LJ006-0007|as the inspectors of prisons found them in eighteen thirty-five to six.|English
LJ006-0008|These gentlemen were appointed in October eighteen thirty-five, owing to the strong representations of the Lords' Committee|English
LJ006-0009|backed up by the evidence of several influential witnesses.|English
LJ006-0010|Mr. Samuel Hoare, when examined, considered it indispensably necessary, to carry out whatever system might be established,|English
LJ006-0011|that inspectors should watch over the observance of the law. He saw no objection on the score of their probable interference with the local jurisdiction,|English
LJ006-0012|but he would not arm them with any authority lest their cooperation might be offensive.|English
LJ006-0013|Sir Frederick Roe was of the same opinion as regards the appointment, but he would give the inspectors the power of acting as well as reporting.|English
LJ006-0014|They should be persons, he thought, selected from the highest class; the duty was most important,|English
LJ006-0015|one which required discretion, judgment, and knowledge of law, with sufficient insight and experience to discover defects in prison discipline.|English
LJ006-0016|These considerations no doubt had weight|English
LJ006-0017|with those who made the selection of the first inspectors, and the two gentlemen appointed were probably the most fitted in England to be so employed.|English
LJ006-0018|One was Mr. William Crawford, the other the Rev. Whitworth Russell.|English
LJ006-0019|The first named had long been an active philanthropist, devoting himself more particularly to the reformation of juvenile criminals.|English
LJ006-0020|William Crawford had been one of the promoters and managers of the Philanthropic Society's farm school.|English
LJ006-0021|Later on he had devoted himself to the personal investigation of the prisons of the United States.|English
LJ006-0022|At that time the mild and intelligent prison discipline in force in Pennsylvania, the legacy of the old Quaker immigrants,|English
LJ006-0023|had made such prisons as Auburn a model for imitation.|English
LJ006-0024|Several European states had dispatched emissaries to examine and report upon them.|English
LJ006-0025|France had sent Misseurs Beaumont and De Tocqueville, who subsequently published several interesting works on the subject.|English
LJ006-0026|England was represented by Mr. Crawford, and the result of his inquiry was given to the public as an appendix to the House of Commons' Report on Secondary Punishments.|English
LJ006-0027|It is an able and exhaustive state paper, testifying to the keenness of the writer's perception, and his unremitting labor in pursuing his researches.|English
LJ006-0028|Mr. Crawford was thoroughly versed in the still imperfectly understood science of prison management, and fully qualified for his new duties.|English
LJ006-0029|The second inspector, the Rev. Whitworth Russell, was the chaplain of Millbank penitentiary,|English
LJ006-0030|the great architectural experiment which grew out of the strong representations of Jeremy Bentham and others, and was the first national recognition of the principle|English
LJ006-0031|that punishment must be reformatory as well as deterrent.|English
LJ006-0032|Messrs. Crawford and Russell proceeded to carry out their new functions with commendable energy, and without a moment's loss of time.|English
LJ006-0033|The ink was barely dry upon their letters of appointment before they appeared at Newgate, and commenced a searching investigation.|English
LJ006-0034|They attended early and late; they mustered the prisoners, examined into their condition,|English
LJ006-0035|took voluminous evidence from all classes of individuals, from the governor down to the convict in the condemned cells.|English
LJ006-0036|They visited the wards after locking-up time, and saw with their own eyes what went on.|English
LJ006-0038|a subject of magnitude and importance sufficient to exclude other jails, they soon narrowed their inquiry still further,|English
LJ006-0039|and limited it to Newgate alone. Newgate indeed became the sole theme of their first report.|English
LJ006-0040|The fact was that the years as they passed, nearly twenty in all, had worked but little permanent improvement in this detestable prison.|English
LJ006-0041|Changes introduced under pressure had been only skin deep.|English
LJ006-0042|Relapse was rapid and inevitable, so that the latter state of the prison was worse than the first.|English
LJ006-0043|The disgraceful overcrowding had been partially ended, but the same evils of indiscriminate association were still present; there was the old neglect of decency,|English
LJ006-0044|the same callous indifference to the moral well-being of the prisoners, the same want of employment and of all disciplinary control.|English
LJ006-0045|All these evils were set forth at length in the inspectors' first report.|English
LJ006-0046|There was no longer the faintest possible excuse for overcrowding. The numbers now committed to Newgate had sensibly diminished.|English
LJ006-0047|The prison had become more or less a place of detention only, harboring mainly those awaiting trial.|English
LJ006-0048|To these were still added an average of about fifty expecting the last penalty of the law; a certain number of transports awaiting removal to the colonies;|English
LJ006-0049|an occasional prisoner or two committed by the Houses of Parliament, the Courts of King's Bench, Common Pleas,|English
LJ006-0050|the Exchequer, the Commissioners of bankruptcy and of taxes; smugglers, and a larger number sentenced for very short terms,|English
LJ006-0051|and for offenses of the most varying description, by the Central Criminal Court.|English
LJ006-0052|The sum total thus produced was inconsiderable compared with the hundreds that had formerly filled the jail,|English
LJ006-0053|and the whole by proper management might have been so accommodated as to prevent overcrowding.|English
LJ006-0054|But incredible as it may appear, the authorities of Newgate declined to avail themselves of the advantages offered them,|English
LJ006-0055|and when the population fell they shut up one half the jail and crowded up the other.|English
LJ006-0056|Some rooms remained quite empty and unoccupied, while others were full to overflowing.|English
LJ006-0057|Not only were the wards thus needlessly crammed, and for no reason but the niggardliness of the corporation which refused a proper supply of bedding|English
LJ006-0058|but the occupants of each were huddled together indiscriminately. The inspectors found in the same wards in the chapel yard the convicted and the untried,|English
LJ006-0059|the felon and the misdemeanant, the sane and the insane, the old and young offender.|English
LJ006-0060|The classification prescribed by the Jail Act, which laid down that certain prisoners should not intermix, was openly neglected,|English
LJ006-0061|"and ""the greatest contempt shown for the law."""|English
LJ006-0062|In another part there were men charged with and convicted of unnatural offenses shut up with lads of tender years;|English
LJ006-0063|minor offenders charged with small thefts or non-payment of small sums were cheek by jowl with convicts sentenced to long terms of transportation.|English
LJ006-0064|In the master's side yard, which had only one washing place, as many as seventy-eight prisoners, frequently more,|English
LJ006-0065|"were associated together, ""of every variety of age, habit, and delinquency, without employment, oversight, or control."""|English
LJ006-0066|In the middle yard it was still worse.|English
LJ006-0067|"Here, say the inspectors, ""are herded together the very worst class of prisoners; certainly a more wretched combination of human beings can hardly be imagined."|English
LJ006-0068|We have reason to fear that poverty, ragged clothes, and an inability to pay the ward dues, elsewhere exacted for better accommodation,|English
LJ006-0069|consign many of the more petty and unpracticed offenders to this place,|English
LJ006-0070|"where they inevitably meet with further contamination from the society of the most abandoned and incorrigible inmates of the jail."""|English
LJ006-0071|No doubt the governor for the time being, Mr. Cope, was in a great measure to blame for all this, and for the want of proper classification.|English
LJ006-0072|I shall have occasion to speak again, and more at length, of Mr. Cope's careless and perfunctory discharge|English
LJ006-0073|of his many manifest duties, but I shall here confine myself to animadverting on his neglect as regards the appropriation of his prison.|English
LJ006-0074|He was unable to give any reason whatever for not utilizing the whole of the wards.|English
LJ006-0075|He saw certain rooms fill up, and yet took no steps to open others that were locked up and empty.|English
LJ006-0076|He blamed the construction of Newgate for the neglect of classification, and was yet compelled to confess that he had made no attempt whatever to carry it out.|English
LJ006-0077|The fact was, he did not keep the classification of prisoners on first arrival in his own hands, nor even in that of his officers.|English
LJ006-0078|A new prisoner's fate, as to location, rested really with a powerful fellow-prisoner.|English
LJ006-0079|The inspectors found that prisoners had their places assigned to them|English
LJ006-0080|"by the inner gatesman, himself a convicted prisoner, and a ""wardsman"" or responsible head of a room."|English
LJ006-0081|The wardsman still exacted dues, of which more directly,|English
LJ006-0082|and this particular official took excellent care to select as residents for his own ward those most suitable from his own point of view.|English
LJ006-0083||English
LJ006-0084|and so numerous were his opportunities of showing favoritism, that all the prisoners may be said to be in his power.|English
LJ006-0085|If a man is poor and ragged, however inexperienced in crime, or however trifling may be the offense for which he has been committed|English
LJ006-0086|his place is assigned among the most depraved, the most experienced, and the most incorrigible offenders in the middle yard.|English
LJ006-0087|It must be admitted that so far but little effort had been made to counteract the evils of indiscriminate association.|English
LJ006-0088|It was not likely that a system which left innocent men -- for the great bulk of new arrivals were still untried|English
LJ006-0089|to be pitchforked by chance anywhere, into any sort of company,|English
LJ006-0090|within this the greatest nursery of crime in London, should exercise even the commonest care for the personal decency or comfort of the prisoners.|English
LJ006-0091|Their treatment was also a matter of chance. They still slept on rope mats on the floor, herded together in companies of four or more to keep one another warm|English
LJ006-0092|and under the scanty covering of a couple of dirty stable-rugs apiece.|English
LJ006-0093|So closely did they lie together, that the inspectors at their night visits found it difficult in stepping across the room to avoid treading on them.|English
LJ006-0094|Sometimes two mats were allotted to three sleepers. Sometimes four slept under the same bedding, and left their mats unoccupied.|English
LJ006-0095|The rugs used were never washed; an order existed that the bedding should be taken into the yards to be aired, but it was not very punctually obeyed.|English
LJ006-0096|The only convenience for personal ablutions were the pumps in the yards, and the far-off baths in the condemned or press-yard.|English
LJ006-0097|Water might not be taken into the ward for washing purposes.|English
LJ006-0098|There was some provision of clothing, but it was quite insufficient, and nothing at all was given if prisoners had enough of their own to cover their nakedness.|English
LJ006-0099|The inspectors paraded the prisoners, and found them generally ragged and ill-clad, squalid and filthy in the extreme;|English
LJ006-0100|many without stockings, and with hardly shoes to their feet;|English
LJ006-0101|some, who had the semblance of covering on the upper part of their feet, had no soles to the shoes, and their bare feet were on the ground.|English
LJ006-0102|This, too, was in the depth of the winter, and during a most inclement season.|English
LJ006-0103|The allowance of food was not illiberal,|English
LJ006-0104|but its issue was precarious, and dependent on the good will of the wardsmen, who measured out the portions to each according to his eye,|English
LJ006-0105|and not with weights and measures, no turnkey being present.|English
LJ006-0106|Too much was left to the wardsman. It was he who could issue small luxuries;|English
LJ006-0107|he sold tea, coffee, sugar, tobacco, although prohibited, and extra beer.|English
LJ006-0108|He charged a weekly sum as ward dues for the use of knives, forks, and plates|English
LJ006-0109|a perpetuation under another form of the old detestable custom of garnish.|English
LJ006-0110|He had power where his exactions were resisted of making the ward most uncomfortable for the defaulter.|English
LJ006-0111|He could trump up a false complaint against his fellow-prisoner, and so get him punished;|English
LJ006-0112|he might keep him from the fire, or give him his soup or gruel in a pail instead of a basin.|English
LJ006-0113|The authority of these wardsmen so improperly exalted, and so entirely unchecked, degenerated into a baneful despotism.|English
LJ006-0114|They bought their offices from one another, and were thus considered to have a vested interest in them.|English
LJ006-0115|Their original capital had been a few shillings, and for this they purchased the right to tax their fellows to the extent of pounds per week.|English
LJ006-0116|The wardsman had a monopoly in supplying provisions, gave dinner and breakfast at his own price, and was such complete master of the ward|English
LJ006-0117|that none of its inmates were suffered to make tea or coffee for themselves lest it should interfere with his sales.|English
LJ006-0118|He made collections when it suited him for ward purposes, to be spent as he chose, in candles and so forth.|English
LJ006-0119|When the wardsman was a man of some education, with some knowledge of legal chicanery gained by personal experience, he might add considerably to his emoluments|English
LJ006-0120|by drawing briefs and petitions for his fellows. There was a recognized charge of five shillings per brief,|English
LJ006-0121|for a petition of from one shilling, half pence to eight shillings, according to its length,|English
LJ006-0122|and by these payments a wardsman had been known to amass as much as forty pounds.|English
LJ006-0123|The man intrusted with this privilege was often the inner gatesman,|English
LJ006-0124|the prisoner official already mentioned, who held the fate of new arrivals as regards location in his hands.|English
LJ006-0125|It was not strange that he should sometimes misuse his power, and when prisoners were not to be cajoled into securing his legal services,|English
LJ006-0126|had been known to employ threats, declaring that he was often consulted by the governor as to a prisoner's character,|English
LJ006-0127|in view of speaking to it at the trial, and he could easily do them a good turn -- or a very bad one.|English
LJ006-0128|The brief-drawing gatesman and wardsman at the time of the inspectors' first visit must have been a particularly powerful personage.|English
LJ006-0129|He was on the most intimate and improperly familiar terms with the turnkeys,|English
LJ006-0130|had a key of both the master's side and middle side yards, was the only person present at the distribution of beer, and was trusted to examine,|English
LJ006-0131|and, if he chose, pass in, all provisions, money, clothes, and letters brought for prisoners by their friends.|English
LJ006-0132|All the wardsmen alike were more or less irresponsible.|English
LJ006-0133|The turnkeys complained bitterly that these old prisoners had more power than they themselves.|English
LJ006-0134|The governor himself admitted that a prisoner of weak intellect who had been severely beaten and much injured by a wardsman did not dare complain|English
LJ006-0135|"the victim of this cruel ill-usage having ""more fear of the power of the wardsman to injure him, than confidence in the governor's power to protect him."""|English
LJ006-0136|These wardsmen, besides thus ruling the roast, had numerous special privileges, if such they can be called.|English
LJ006-0137|"They were not obliged to attend chapel, and seldom if ever went; ""prisoners,"" said one of them under examination, ""did not like the trouble of going to chapel."""|English
LJ006-0138|They had a standing bedstead to sleep on, and a good flock mattress; double allowance of provisions, filched from the common stock.|English
LJ006-0139|Nobody interfered with them or regulated their conduct. They might get drunk when so disposed, and did so frequently, alone or in company.|English
LJ006-0140|"Evidence was given before the inspectors of eight or ten prisoners seen ""giddy drunk, not able to sit upon forms."""|English
LJ006-0141|The female wards-women were also given to intemperance.|English
LJ006-0142|"The matron deposed to having seen the gates-woman ""exceedingly drunk,"" and having been insulted by her."|English
LJ006-0143|There was no penalty attached to drunkenness.|English
LJ006-0144|A wardsman did not necessarily lose his situation for it. Nor was drink the only creature comfort he might enjoy.|English
LJ006-0145|He could indulge in snuff if a snuff-taker,|English
LJ006-0146|and might always smoke his pipe undisturbed; for although the use of tobacco had been prohibited since the report of the Lords Committee,|English
LJ006-0147|it was still freely introduced into the prison.|English
LJ006-0148|Probably authority would not have been so recklessly usurped by the wardsmen had not the proper officials too readily surrendered it.|English
LJ006-0149|The turnkeys left the prisoners very much to themselves, never entering the wards after locking-up time, at dusk, till unlocking next morning,|English
LJ006-0150|and then only went round to count the number.|English
LJ006-0151|Many of them were otherwise and improperly occupied for hours every day in menial services for the governor, cleaning his windows or grooming his horse.|English
LJ006-0152|One turnkey had been so employed several hours daily for nearly eleven years.|English
LJ006-0153|It was not strange that subordinates should neglect their duty when superiors set the example.|English
LJ006-0154|Nothing was more prominently brought out by the inspectors than the inefficiency of the governor at that time, Mr. Cope.|English
LJ006-0155|He may have erred in some points through ignorance, but in others he was clearly guilty of culpable neglect.|English
LJ006-0156|We have seen that he took no pains to classify and separate prisoners on reception.|English
LJ006-0157|This was only one of many grave omissions on his part. He did not feel it incumbent on himself to visit his prison often or see his prisoners.|English
LJ006-0158|The act prescribed that he should do both every twenty-four hours, but days passed without his entering the wards.|English
LJ006-0159|The prisoners declared that they did not see him oftener than twice a week;|English
LJ006-0160|one man who had been in the condemned ward for two months, said the governor only came there four times.|English
LJ006-0161|Again, a turnkey deposed that his chief did not enter the wards more than once a fortnight.|English
LJ006-0162|But it is only fair to Mr. Cope to state that he himself said he went whenever he could find time|English
LJ006-0163|and that he was constantly engaged attending sessions and going with drafts to the hulks.|English
LJ006-0164|But when he did visit, his inspections were of the most superficial character|English
LJ006-0165|sometimes he looked at his bolts and bars, but he never examined the cupboards, coal-boxes, or other possible hiding-places for cards|English
LJ006-0166|dice, dangerous implements, or other prohibited articles.|English
LJ006-0167|He only attended chapel once on Sunday, never on the week-day, and generally devoted the time service was in progress|English
LJ006-0168|to taking the descriptions of newly-arrived prisoners.|English
LJ006-0169|He really did not know what passed in his jail|English
LJ006-0170|and was surprised when the inspectors proved to him that practices of which he was ignorant, and which he admitted that he reprehended, went on without hindrance.|English
LJ006-0171|He was satisfied to let matters run on as in the old times, he said in his own justification; with him what was, was right,|English
LJ006-0172|and evils that should have been speedily rooted out remained because they had the prescription of long usage.|English
LJ006-0173|He kept no daily journal of occurrences, and nothing, however important, was recorded at the time.|English
LJ006-0174|The aldermen never called upon him to report, and left him nearly unsupervised and uncontrolled.|English
LJ006-0175|In his administration of discipline he was quite uncertain;|English
LJ006-0176|the punishments he inflicted were unequal,|English
LJ006-0177|and it was not the least part of the blame imputed to him that he made special favorites of particular prisoners, retaining of his own accord in Newgate,|English
LJ006-0178|and for years, felons who should have been sent beyond the seas.|English
LJ006-0179|But, indeed, his whole rule was far too mild, and under this mistaken leniency|English
LJ006-0180|the interior of the jail was more like a bear-garden or the noisy purlieus of a public-house than a prison.|English
LJ006-0181|It was the same old story -- evil constantly in the ascendant, the least criminal at the mercy of the most depraved.|English
LJ006-0182|Under the reckless contempt for regulations,|English
LJ006-0183|the apathy of the authorities, and the undue ascendancy of those who, as convicted felons, should have been most sternly repressed,|English
LJ006-0184|the most hardened and the oldest in vice had the best of it, while the inexperienced beginner went to the wall.|English
LJ006-0185|Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who spent three years in Newgate a little before the time of the inspectors' first report,|English
LJ006-0186|"said with justice that ""incredible scenes of horror occur in Newgate."""|English
LJ006-0187|It was, moreover, in his opinion undoubtedly the greatest nursery of crime in London.|English
LJ006-0188|The days were passed in idleness, debauchery, riotous quarreling, immoral conversation,|English
LJ006-0189|gambling, indirect contravention of parliamentary rules, instruction in all nefarious processes,|English
LJ006-0190|lively discourse upon past criminal exploits, elaborate discussion of others to be perpetrated after release.|English
LJ006-0191|No provision whatever was made for the employment of prisoners, no materials were purchased, no trade instructors appointed.|English
LJ006-0192|There was no school for adults; only the boys were taught anything, and their instructor, with his assistant, were convicted prisoners.|English
LJ006-0193|Idle hands and unoccupied brains found in mischief the only means of whiling away the long hours of incarceration.|English
LJ006-0194|Gaming of all kinds, although forbidden by the Jail Acts, was habitually practiced.|English
LJ006-0195|This was admitted in evidence by the turnkeys, and was proved by the appearance of the prison tables, which bore the marks of gaming-boards deeply cut into them.|English
LJ006-0196|"Prisoners confessed that it was a favorite occupation, the chief games being ""shoving halfpence"" on the table,"|English
LJ006-0197|pitch in the hole, cribbage, dominoes, and common tossing, at which as much as four or five shillings would change hands in an hour.|English
LJ006-0198|But this was not the only amusement. Most of the wards took in the daily papers,|English
LJ006-0199|"the most popular being the ""Times,"" ""Morning Herald,"" and ""Morning Chronicle""; on Sunday the ""Weekly Dispatch,"" ""Bell's Life,"" and the ""Weekly Messenger."""|English
LJ006-0200|The newsman had free access to the prison; he passed in unsearched and unexamined, and, unaccompanied by an officer,|English
LJ006-0201|went at once to his customers, who bought their paper and paid for it themselves.|English
LJ006-0202|The news-vendor was also a tobacconist,|English
LJ006-0203|and he had thus ample means of introducing to the prisoners the prohibited but always much-coveted and generally procurable weed.|English
LJ006-0204|In the same way the wardsman laid in his stock to be retailed. Other light literature besides the daily journals were in circulation:|English
LJ006-0205|"novels, flash songs, play-books, such as ""Jane Shore,"" ""Grimm's German Tales,"" with Cruikshank's illustrations,"|English
LJ006-0206|and publications which in these days would have been made the subject of a criminal prosecution.|English
LJ006-0207|"One of these, published by Stockdale, the inspectors styled ""a book of the most disgusting nature."""|English
LJ006-0208|There was also a good supply of Bibles and prayers,|English
LJ006-0209|the donation of a philanthropic gentleman, Captain Brown, but these, particularly the Bibles, bore little appearance of having been used.|English
LJ006-0210|Drink, in more or less unlimited quantities, was still to be had.|English
LJ006-0211|Spirits certainly were now excluded; but a potman, with full permission of the sheriffs,|English
LJ006-0212|brought in beer for sale from a neighboring public-house, and visited all the wards with no other escort than the prisoner gatesman.|English
LJ006-0213|The quantity to be issued per head was limited by the prison regulations to one pint|English
LJ006-0214|but no steps were taken to prevent any prisoner from obtaining more if he could pay for it.|English
LJ006-0215|The beer-man brought in as much as he pleased; he sold it without the controlling presence of an officer.|English
LJ006-0216|"Not only did prisoners come again and again for a ""pint,"" but large quantities were carried off to the wards to be drunk later in the day."|English
LJ006-0217|There were more varied, and at times, especially when beer had circulated freely, more uproarious diversions.|English
LJ006-0218|"Wrestling, in which legs were occasionally broken, was freely indulged in; also such low games as ""cobham,"""|English
LJ006-0219|"leap-frog, puss in the corner, and ""fly the garter,"" for which purpose the rugs were spread out to prevent feet slipping on the floor."|English
LJ006-0220|Feasting alternated with fighting.|English
LJ006-0221|The weekly introduction of food, to which I shall presently refer, formed the basis of luxurious banquets, washed down by liquor|English
LJ006-0222|"and enlivened by flash songs and thrilling long-winded descriptions of robberies and other ""plants."""|English
LJ006-0223|There was much swearing and bad language, the very worst that could be used, from the first thing in the morning to the last thing at night.|English
LJ006-0224|"New arrivals, especially the innocent and still guileless debutant, were tormented with rude horse-play, and assailed by the most insulting ""chaff."""|English
LJ006-0225|If any man presumed to turn in too early|English
LJ006-0226|"he was ""toed,"" that is to say, a string was fastened to his big toe while he was asleep, and he was dragged from off his mat,"|English
LJ006-0227|or his bedclothes were drawn away across the room.|English
LJ006-0228|The ragged part of the prisoners were very anxious to destroy the clothes of the better dressed, and often lighted small pieces of cloth,|English
LJ006-0229|which they dropped smoldering into their fellow-prisoners' pockets.|English
LJ006-0230|Often the victim, goaded to madness, attacked his tormentors; a fight was then certain to follow.|English
LJ006-0231|These fights sometimes took place in the daytime, when a ring was regularly formed, and two or three stood by the door to watch for the officer's approach.|English
LJ006-0232|More often they occurred at night, and were continued to the bitter end.|English
LJ006-0233|The prisoners in this way administered serious punishment on one another. Black eyes and broken noses were always to be seen.|English
LJ006-0234|More cruel injuries were common enough, which did not result from honest hand-to-hand fights.|English
LJ006-0235|The surgeon's journal produced to the inspectors contained numerous entries of terrible wounds inflicted in a cowardly way.|English
LJ006-0236|A serious accident: one of the prisoners had a hot poker run into his eye.|English
LJ006-0237|A lad named Matthew White has had a wound in his eye by a bone thrown at him, which very nearly destroyed vision.|English
LJ006-0238||English
LJ006-0239|During the tumult a prisoner, who was one of the worst of the rioters, was bruised about the head and body.|English
LJ006-0240|Watkins' knee-joint is very severely injured.|English
LJ006-0241|A prisoner Baxter is in the infirmary in consequence of a severe injury to his wrist-joint.|English
LJ006-0242|Watkins' case, referred to above, is made the subject of another and a special report from the surgeon.|English
LJ006-0243|He was in the transport side, when one of his fellows, in endeavoring to strike another prisoner with a large poker, missed his aim, and struck Watkins' knee|English
LJ006-0244|Violent inflammation and extensive suppuration ensued, and for a considerable time amputation seemed inevitable.|English
LJ006-0245|After severe suffering prolonged for many months, the inflammation was subdued, but the cartilage of the knee-joint was destroyed, and he was crippled for life.|English
LJ006-0246|On another occasion a young man, who was being violently teased, seized a knife and stabbed his tormentor in the back.|English
LJ006-0247|The prisoner who used the knife was secured, but it was the wardsman, and not the officers, to whom the report was made, and no official inquiry or punishment followed.|English
LJ006-0248|Matters were at times still worse, and the rioting went on to such dangerous lengths as to endanger the safety of the building.|English
LJ006-0249|On one occasion a disturbance was raised which was not quelled until windows had been broken and forms and tables burnt.|English
LJ006-0250|The officers were obliged to go in among the prisoners to restore order with drawn cutlasses,|English
LJ006-0251|but the presence and authority of the governor himself became indispensable.|English
LJ006-0252|The worst fights occurred on Sunday afternoons; but nearly every night the act of locking up became, from the consequent removal of all supervision,|English
LJ006-0253|the signal for the commencement of obscene talk, revelry, and violence.|English
LJ006-0254|Other regulations laid down by the Jail Acts were still defied. One of these was that prisoners should be restricted to the jail allowance of food;|English
LJ006-0255|but all could still obtain as much extra, and of a luxurious kind, as their friends chose to bring them in.|English
LJ006-0256|Visitors were still permitted to come with supplies on given days of the week, about the only limitation being that the food should be cooked, and cold;|English
LJ006-0257|hot meat, poultry, and fish were also forbidden.|English
LJ006-0258|But the inspectors found in the ward cupboards mince-pies and other pasties, cold joints, hams, and so forth.|English
LJ006-0259|Many other articles were introduced by visitors, including money, tobacco, pipes, and snuff.|English
LJ006-0260|From the same source came the two or three strong files which the inspectors found in one ward,|English
LJ006-0261|together with four bradawls, several large iron spikes, screws, nails, and knives;|English
LJ006-0262|all of them instruments calculated to facilitate attempts at breaking out of prison,|English
LJ006-0263|and capable of becoming most dangerous weapons in the hands of desperate and determined men.|English
LJ006-0264|The nearly indiscriminate admission of visitors, although restricted to certain days, continued to be an unmixed evil.|English
LJ006-0265|The untried might see their friends three times a week, the convicted only once.|English
LJ006-0266|On these occasions precautions were supposed to be taken to exclude bad characters,|English
LJ006-0267|yet many persons of notoriously loose life continually obtained egress.|English
LJ006-0268|Women saw men if they merely pretended to be wives; even boys were visited by their sweethearts.|English
LJ006-0269|Decency was, however, insured by a line of demarcation, and visitors were kept upon each side of a separated double iron railing.|English
LJ006-0270|But no search was made to intercept prohibited articles at the gate, and there was no permanent gate-keeper,|English
LJ006-0271|which would have greatly helped to keep out bad characters. Some idea of the difficulty and inconvenience of these lax regulations as regards visiting,|English
LJ006-0272|may be gathered from the statement that as many as three hundred were often admitted on the same day|English
LJ006-0273|enough to altogether upset what small show of decorum and discipline was still preserved in the prison.|English
LJ006-0274|"Perhaps the worst feature of the visiting system was the permission accorded to male prisoners ""under the name of husbands, brothers, and sons"""|English
LJ006-0275|to have access to the female side on Sundays and Wednesdays, in order to visit their supposed relations there.|English
LJ006-0276|On this female side, where the Ladies' Association still reigned supreme, more system and a greater semblance of decorum was maintained.|English
LJ006-0277|But there were evils akin to those on the male side, prominent amongst which was the undue influence accorded to prisoners.|English
LJ006-0278|A female prisoner kept the registers.|English
LJ006-0279|Wards-women were allowed much the same authority, with the same temptations to excess, and intoxication was not unknown among them and others.|English
LJ006-0280|The clothing was still meager and ragged: the washing places insufficient, and wanting in decency;|English
LJ006-0281|in some yards|English
LJ006-0282|the pump was the only provision, and this in a place within sight of visitors, of the windows of the male turnkeys, and unprotected from the weather.|English
LJ006-0283|There was the same crowding in the sleeping arrangements as on the male side; the same scarcity of bedding.|English
LJ006-0284|It was a special evil of this part of the prison, that the devotional exercises, originally so profitable, had grown into a kind of edifying spectacle,|English
LJ006-0285|which numbers of well-meaning but inquisitive people were anxious to witness.|English
LJ006-0286|Thus, when the inspectors visited there were twenty-three strangers, and only twenty-eight prisoners.|English
LJ006-0287|The presence of so many strangers, many of them gentlemen, distracted the prisoners' attention, and could not be productive of much good.|English
LJ006-0288|The separation of the sexes was not indeed rigidly carried out in Newgate as yet.|English
LJ006-0289|We have seen that male prisoners visited their female relations and friends on the female side. Besides this,|English
LJ006-0290|the gatesman who prepared the briefs had interviews with female prisoners alone while taking their instructions; a female came alone and unaccompanied by a matron|English
LJ006-0291|to clean the governor's office in the male prison;|English
LJ006-0292|male prisoners carried coal into the female prison, when they saw and could speak or pass letters to the female prisoners;|English
LJ006-0293|and the men could also at any time go for tea, coffee, and sugar to Mrs. Brown's shop, which was inside the female gate.|English
LJ006-0294|In the bail-dock, where most improper general association was permitted, the female prisoners were often altogether in the charge of male turnkeys.|English
LJ006-0295|The governor was also personally responsible for gross contravention of this rule of separation,|English
LJ006-0296|and was in the habit of drawing frequently upon the female prison for prisoners to act as domestic servants in his own private dwelling.|English
LJ006-0297|"Some member of the Ladies' Association observed and commented upon the fact that a ""young rosy-cheeked girl"" had been kept by the governor from transportation,"|English
LJ006-0298|while older women in infirm health were sent across the seas.|English
LJ006-0299|His excuse was that he had given the girl his promise that she should not go, an assumption of prerogative which by no means rested with him;|English
LJ006-0300|but he afterwards admitted that the girl had been recommended to him by the principal turnkey, who knew something of her friends.|English
LJ006-0301|This woman was really his servant, employed to help in cleaning, and taken on whenever there was extra work to be done.|English
LJ006-0302|The governor had a great dislike, he said, to seeing strangers in his house.|English
LJ006-0303|This girl had been first engaged on account of the extra work entailed by certain prisoners|English
LJ006-0304|committed by the House of Commons, who had been lodged in the governor's own house.|English
LJ006-0305|The house at this time was full of men and visitors; waiters came in from the taverns with meals.|English
LJ006-0306|Some of the prisoners had their valets, and all these were constantly in and out of the kitchen where this female prisoner was employed.|English
LJ006-0307|"There was reveling and roistering, as usual, with ""high life below-stairs."|English
LJ006-0308|The governor sent down wine on festive occasions, of which no doubt the prisoner housemaid had her share.|English
LJ007-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section ten: The first report of the inspector of prisons.|English
LJ007-0002|"Eighteen years had elapsed since the formation of the ""Ladies' Association,"""|English
LJ007-0003|and Mrs. Fry with her colleagues still labored assiduously in Newgate, devoting themselves mainly to the female prison,|English
LJ007-0004|although their ministrations were occasionally extended to the male side.|English
LJ007-0005|The inspectors paid tribute to the excellence of the motives of these philanthropic ladies, and recognized the good they did.|English
LJ007-0006|"They had introduced ""much order and cleanliness,"""|English
LJ007-0007|had provided work for those who had hitherto passed their time in total idleness, and had made the treatment of female transports on the way to New South Wales|English
LJ007-0008|their especial care.|English
LJ007-0009|They had tried, moreover,|English
LJ007-0010|by their presence and their pious, disinterested efforts, to restrain the dissolute manners and vicious language of the unhappy and depraved inmates.|English
LJ007-0011|But it was already plain that they constituted an independent authority within the jails; they were frequently in conflict with the chaplain,|English
LJ007-0012|who not strangely resented the orders issued by the aldermen|English
LJ007-0013|that women should be frequently kept from chapel in order that they might attend the ladies' lectures and exhortations.|English
LJ007-0014|The admission of a crowd of visitors to assist in these lay services has already been remarked upon; as the inspectors pointed out,|English
LJ007-0015|it had the bad effect of distracting attention,|English
LJ007-0016|"it tended to ""dissipate reflection, diminish the gloom of the prison, and mitigate the punishment which the law has sentenced the prisoner to undergo."""|English
LJ007-0017|It is to be feared too that although the surface was thus whitewashed and decorous, much that was vicious still festered and rankled beneath,|English
LJ007-0018|and that when the restraining influences of the ladies were absent, the female prisoners relapsed into immoral and uncleanly discourse.|English
LJ007-0019|"Even in the daytime, when supervision was withdrawn, ""the language used to be dreadful,"" says one of the women when under examination;"|English
LJ007-0020|swearing and talking of what crimes they had committed, and how they had done it. Another witness declared she had heard the most shocking language in the yard; she said|English
LJ007-0021|she had never witnessed such scenes before, and hopes she never shall again -- it was dreadful!|English
LJ007-0022|After locking-up time, which varied, as on the male side, according to the daylight, the scenes were often riotous and disgraceful.|English
LJ007-0023|The poor, who could afford no luxuries, went to bed early, but were kept awake by the revelries of the rich,|English
LJ007-0024|who supped royally on the supplies provided from outside, and kept it up till ten or eleven o'clock.|English
LJ007-0025|There were frequent quarrels and fights; shoes and other missiles were freely bandied about;|English
LJ007-0026|"and with all this ""the most dreadful oaths, the worst language, too bad to be repeated,"" were made use of every night."|English
LJ007-0027|Bad as were the various parts of the jail already dealt with,|English
LJ007-0028|there still remained one where the general callous indifference and mismanagement culminated in cruel culpable neglect.|English
LJ007-0029|The condition of the capitally-convicted prisoners after sentence was still very disgraceful. The side they occupied, still known as the press-yard,|English
LJ007-0030|consisted of two dozen rooms and fifteen cells. In these various chambers, until just before the inspectors made their report,|English
LJ007-0031|all classes of the condemned, those certain to suffer, and the larger number who were nearly certain of a reprieve,|English
LJ007-0032|were jumbled up together, higgledy-piggledy, the old and the young, the murderer and the child who had broken into a dwelling.|English
LJ007-0033|All privacy was impossible under the circumstances.|English
LJ007-0034|At times the numbers congregated together were very great; as many as fifty and sixty, even more, were crowded indiscriminately into the press-yard.|English
LJ007-0035|The better-disposed complained bitterly of what they had to endure;|English
LJ007-0036|one man declared that the language of the condemned rooms was disgusting, that he was dying a death every day in being compelled to associate with such characters.|English
LJ007-0037|In the midst of the noisy and blasphemous talk no one could pursue his meditations; any who tried to pray became the sport and ridicule of his brutal fellows.|English
LJ007-0038|Owing to the repeated entreaties of the criminals who could hardly hope to escape the gallows, some show of classification was carried out,|English
LJ007-0039|and when the inspectors visited Newgate they found the three certain to die in a day-room by themselves;|English
LJ007-0040|in a second room were fourteen more who had every hope of a reprieve.|English
LJ007-0041|The whole of these seventeen had, however, a common airing-yard, and took their exercise there at the same time,|English
LJ007-0042|so that men in the most awful situation, daily expecting to be hanged,|English
LJ007-0043|were associated continually with a number of those who could look with certainty on a mitigation of punishment.|English
LJ007-0044|"The latter, light-hearted and reckless, conducted themselves in the most unseemly fashion, and ""with as much indifference as the inmates of the other parts of the prison."""|English
LJ007-0045|They amused themselves after their own fashion; played all day long at blind-man's-buff and leap-frog, or beat each other with a knotted handkerchief,|English
LJ007-0046|laughing and uproarious, utterly unmindful of the companionship of men upon whom lay the shadow of an impending shameful death.|English
LJ007-0047|Men whose cases were dangerous, and those most seriously inclined, complained of these annoyances,|English
LJ007-0048|so subversive of meditation, so disturbing to the thoughts;|English
LJ007-0049|they suffered sickening anxiety, and wished to be locked up alone. This indiscriminate association lasted for months,|English
LJ007-0050|during the whole of which time the unhappy convicts who had but little hope of commutation were exposed to the mockery of their reckless associates.|English
LJ007-0051|The brutal callousness of the bulk of the inmates of the press-yard may be gathered from the prison punishment-book, which frequently recorded such entries as the following:|English
LJ007-0052|Benjamin Vines and Daniel Ward put in irons for two days for breaking the windows of the day room in the condemned cells.|English
LJ007-0053|Joseph Coleman put in irons for three days for striking one of the prisoners, in the same place.|English
LJ007-0054|There were disputes and quarrels constantly among these doomed men; it was a word and blow, an argument clenched always with a fight.|English
LJ007-0055|The more peaceably disposed found some occupation in making Newgate tokens,|English
LJ007-0056|"leaden hearts, and ""grinding the impressions off penny-pieces, then pricking figures or words on them to give to their friends as memorials."|English
LJ007-0057|Turnkeys occasionally visited the press-yard, but its occupants were under little or no control.|English
LJ007-0058|The chaplain, who might have been expected to make these men his peculiar care, and who at one time had visited them frequently, often several times a week,|English
LJ007-0059|had relaxed his efforts, because, according to his own account, he was so frequently stopped in the performance of his duties.|English
LJ007-0060|"In his evidence before the inspectors he declared that ""for years he gave his whole time to his duties, from an early hour in the morning till late in the afternoon."|English
LJ007-0061|He left off because he was so much interfered with and laughed at, and from seeing that no success attended his efforts, owing to the evils arising from association.|English
LJ007-0062|Latterly his ministrations to the condemned had been restricted to a visit on Sunday afternoons, and occasionally about once a fortnight on a week-day.|English
LJ007-0063|It is only fair to Mr. Cotton to add that, according to his own journal, he was unremitting in his attentions to convicts who were actually cast for death,|English
LJ007-0064|and the day of whose execution was fixed. He had no doubt a difficult mission to discharge;|English
LJ007-0065|on the one hand, the Ladies' Association, supported and encouraged by public approval, trenched upon his peculiar province;|English
LJ007-0066|on the other, the governor of the jail sneered at his zeal|English
LJ007-0067|"stigmatized his often most just strictures on abuses as ""a bundle of nonsense,"" and the aldermen, when he appealed to them for protection and countenance,"|English
LJ007-0068|generally sided with his opponents. Nevertheless the inspectors summed up against him.|English
LJ007-0069|While admitting that he had had many difficulties to contend with,|English
LJ007-0070|"and that he had again and again protested against the obstacles thrown in his way, the inspectors ""cannot forbear expressing their opinion that he might have shown greater perseverance,"|English
LJ007-0071|in the face of impediments confessedly discouraging|English
LJ007-0072|"as regards the private teaching of prisoners; and they went on to say that ""a resolved adherence, in spite of discouragements the most disheartening,"|English
LJ007-0073|to that line of conduct which his duty imposed on him|English
LJ007-0074|would, it is probable, have eventually overcome the reluctance of some of the prisoners at least, and would have possessed so much moral dignity|English
LJ007-0075|as effectually to rebuke and abash the profane spirit of the more insolent and daring of the criminals.|English
LJ007-0076|The lax discipline maintained in Newgate was still further deteriorated by the presence of two other classes of prisoners who ought never to have been inmates of such a jail.|English
LJ007-0077|One of these were the criminal lunatics, who were at this time and for long previous continuously imprisoned there.|English
LJ007-0078|As the law stood since the passing of the ninth George the fourth c. forty, any two justices might remove a prisoner found to be insane, either on commitment|English
LJ007-0079|or arraignment, to an asylum, and the Secretary of State had the same power as regards any who became insane while undergoing sentence.|English
LJ007-0080|These powers were not invariably put in force, and there were in consequence many unhappy lunatics in Newgate and other jails,|English
LJ007-0081|whose proper place was the asylum.|English
LJ007-0082|At the time the Lords' Committee sat there were eight thus retained in Newgate, and a return in the appendix of the Lords' report|English
LJ007-0083|gives a total of thirty-nine lunatics confined in various jails, many of them guilty of murder and other serious crimes.|English
LJ007-0084|The inspectors in the following year, on examining the facts, found that some of these poor creatures had been in confinement for long periods:|English
LJ007-0085|"at Newgate and York Castle as long as five years; ""at Ilchester and Morpeth for seven years; at Warwick for eight years,"|English
LJ007-0086|at Buckingham and Hereford for eleven years|English
LJ007-0087|at Appleby for thirteen years, at Anglesea for fifteen years, at Exeter for sixteen years, and at Pembroke|English
LJ007-0088|for not less a period than twenty-four years.|English
LJ007-0089|"It was manifestly wrong that such persons, ""visited by the most awful of calamities,"" should be detained in a common prison."|English
LJ007-0090|Not only did their presence tend greatly to interfere with the discipline of the prison, but their condition was deplorable in the extreme.|English
LJ007-0091|The lunatic became the sport of the idle and the depraved. His cure was out of the question;|English
LJ007-0092|"he was placed in a situation ""beyond all others calculated to confirm his malady and prolong his sufferings."""|English
LJ007-0093|The matter was still further complicated at Newgate by the presence within the walls of sham lunatics. Some of those included in the category|English
LJ007-0094|had actually been returned as sane from the asylum to which they had been sent, and there was always some uncertainty as to who was mad and who not.|English
LJ007-0095|Prisoners indeed were known to boast that they had saved their necks by feigning insanity.|English
LJ007-0096|It was high time that the unsatisfactory state of the law as regards the treatment of criminal lunatics should be remedied|English
LJ007-0097|and not the least of the good services rendered by the new inspectors was their inquiry into the status of these unfortunate people, and their recommendation to improve it.|English
LJ007-0098|The other inmates of the prison of an exceptional character, and exempted from the regular discipline, such as it was,|English
LJ007-0099|were the ten persons committed to Newgate by the House of Commons in eighteen thirty-five.|English
LJ007-0100|These were the gentlemen concerned in the bribery case at Ipswich in eighteen thirty-five,|English
LJ007-0101|when a petition was presented against the return of Messrs. Adam Dundas and Fitzroy Kelly. Various witnesses, including Messrs. J. B. Dasent,|English
LJ007-0102|Pilgrim, Bond, and Clamp, had refused to give evidence before the House of Commons' Committee; a Speaker's warrant was issued for their arrest when they absconded.|English
LJ007-0103|Mr. J. E. Sparrow and Mr. Clipperton|English
LJ007-0104|the parliamentary agents of the members whose election was impugned, were implicated in aiding and abetting the others to abscond, and a Mr. O'Mally,|English
LJ007-0105|counsel for the two M.P.'s, was also concerned.|English
LJ007-0106|Pilgrim and Dasent were caught and given into the custody of the sergeant-at-arms, and the rest were either arrested or they surrendered.|English
LJ007-0107|A resolution at once passed the House without division to commit the whole to Newgate, where they remained for various terms.|English
LJ007-0108|Dasent and Pilgrim were released in ten days, on making due submission.|English
LJ007-0109|O'Mally sent in a medical certificate, declaring that the imprisonment was endangering his life, and after some question he was also released.|English
LJ007-0110|The rest were detained for more than a month, it being considered that they were the most guilty, as being either professional agents, who advised the others to abscond,|English
LJ007-0111|or witnesses who did not voluntarily come forward when the chance was given them.|English
LJ007-0112|Many of the old customs once prevalent in the State Side, so properly condemned and abolished,|English
LJ007-0113|were revived for the convenience of these gentlemen, whose incarceration was thus rendered as little like imprisonment as possible.|English
LJ007-0114|A certain number, who could afford the high rate of a guinea per diem, fixed by the under sheriff, were lodged in the governor's house,|English
LJ007-0115|slept there, and had their meals provided for them from the Sessions House or London Coffee-House.|English
LJ007-0116|A few others, who could not afford a payment of more than half a guinea, were permitted to monopolize a part of the prison infirmary,|English
LJ007-0117|where the upper ward was exclusively appropriated to their use. They also had their meals sent in, and, with the food, wine almost ad libitum.|English
LJ007-0118|A prisoner, one of the wardsmen, waited on those in the infirmary; the occupants of the governor's house had their own servants, or the governor's.|English
LJ007-0119|As a rule, visitors, many of them persons of good position, came and went all day long, and as late as nine at night;|English
LJ007-0120|some to the infirmary, many more to the governor's house.|English
LJ007-0121|There were no restraints, cards and backgammon were played, and the time passed in feasting and revelry.|English
LJ007-0122|Even Mr. Cope admitted that the committal of this class of prisoners to Newgate was most inconvenient,|English
LJ007-0123|and the inspectors expressed themselves still more strongly in reprehension of the practice.|English
LJ007-0124|The infirmary at this particular period epitomized the condition of the jail at large.|English
LJ007-0125|"It was diverted from its proper uses, and, as the ""place of the greatest comfort,"" was allotted to persons who should not have been sent to Newgate at all."|English
LJ007-0126|All the evils of indiscriminate association were strongly accentuated by the crowd collected within its narrow limits.|English
LJ007-0127|It may easily be imagined, say the inspectors, in speaking of the prison generally,|English
LJ007-0128||English
LJ007-0129|the sane and the insane, the young and the old, the trivial offender and the man about to suffer the extreme penalty of the law,|English
LJ007-0130|"are all huddled together without discrimination, oversight, or control."""|English
LJ007-0131|Enough has probably been extracted from this most damnatory report to give a complete picture of the disgraceful state in which Newgate still remained in eighteen thirty-five.|English
LJ007-0132|The inspectors, however, honestly admitted that although the site of the prison was convenient, its construction was as bad as bad could be.|English
LJ007-0133|Valuable space was cumbered with many long and winding passages, numerous staircases, and unnecessarily thick and cumbrous inner walls.|English
LJ007-0134|The wards were in some cases spacious, but they were entirely unsuited for separation or the inspection of prisoners.|English
LJ007-0135|The yards were narrow and confined, mainly because the ground plan was radically vicious. These were evils inseparable from the place.|English
LJ007-0136|But there were others remediable under a better system of management.|English
LJ007-0137|More attention to ventilation, which was altogether neglected and inadequate, would have secured a better atmosphere for the unhappy inmates|English
LJ007-0138|who constantly breathed an air heavy, and, when the wards were first opened in the morning, particularly offensive.|English
LJ007-0139|Again, the discipline commonly deemed inseparable from every place of durance was entirely wanting.|English
LJ007-0140|The primary object of committing a prisoner to jail, as the inspectors pointed out, was to deter not only the criminal himself, but others from crime,|English
LJ007-0141|"and ""to dispose him, by meditation and seclusion, to return to an honest life."""|English
LJ007-0142|But at Newgate the convicted prisoner, instead of privation and hard fare,|English
LJ007-0143||English
LJ007-0144|and he can almost invariably procure the luxuries of his class of life, beer and tobacco, in abundance.|English
LJ007-0145|Instead of seclusion and meditation, his time is passed in the midst of a body of criminals of every class and degree, in riot, debauchery, and gaming,|English
LJ007-0146|vaunting his own adventures, or listening to those of others;|English
LJ007-0147|communicating his own skill and aptitude in crime, or acquiring the lessons of greater adepts. He has access to newspapers, and of course|English
LJ007-0148|prefers that description which are expressly prepared for his own class, and which abound in vulgar adventure in criminal enterprise, and in the histories of the police,|English
LJ007-0149|the jail, and the scaffold.|English
LJ007-0150|He is allowed intercourse with prostitutes who, in nine cases out of ten, have originally conduced to his ruin;|English
LJ007-0151|and his connection with them is confirmed by that devotion and generosity towards their paramours in adversity for which these otherwise degraded women are remarkable.|English
LJ007-0152|Having thus passed his time, he returns a greater adept in crime, with a wider acquaintance among criminals, and, what perhaps is even more injurious to him,|English
LJ007-0153|"is generally known to all the worst men in the country; not only without the inclination, but almost without the ability of returning to an honest life."""|English
LJ007-0154|These pungent and well-grounded strictures applied with still greater force to the unconvicted prisoner, the man who came to the prison innocent, and still uncontaminated,|English
LJ007-0155|to be subjected to the same baneful influences, and to suffer the same moral deterioration, whether ultimately convicted or set free.|English
LJ007-0156|The whole system, or more correctly the want of system, was baneful and pernicious to the last degree.|English
LJ007-0157|"The evils of such association were aggravated by the unbroken idleness; one ""evil inflamed the other;"" reformation"|English
LJ007-0158|or any kind of moral improvement was impossible; the prisoner's career was inevitably downward, till he struck the lowest depths.|English
LJ007-0159|Forced and constant intercourse with the most depraved individuals of his own class;|English
LJ007-0160|the employment of those means and agents by which the lowest passions and the most vulgar propensities of man are perpetually kept in the highest state of excitement|English
LJ007-0161|drink, gaming, obscene and blasphemous language; utter idleness, the almost unrestricted admission of money and luxuries;|English
LJ007-0162|uncontrolled conversation with visitors of the very worst description -- prostitutes, thieves, receivers of stolen goods|English
LJ007-0163|all the tumultuous and diversified passions and emotions which circumstances like these must necessarily generate|English
LJ007-0164|forbid the faintest shadow of a hope that in a soil so unfavorable for moral culture|English
LJ007-0165|any awakening truth, salutary exhortation, or imperfect resolutions of amendment can take root or grow.|English
LJ007-0166|Strong as were the foregoing remarks, the inspectors wound up their report in still more trenchant language|English
LJ007-0167|framing a terrible indictment against those responsible for the condition of Newgate. Their words deserve to be quoted in full.|English
LJ007-0168|"We cannot close these remarks, say the inspectors, ""without an expression of the painful feelings with which we submit to your Lordship"|English
LJ007-0169|this picture of the existing state of Newgate|English
LJ007-0170|That in this vast metropolis, the center of wealth, civilization, and information;|English
LJ007-0171|distinguished as the seat of religion, worth, and philanthropy,|English
LJ007-0172|where is to be found in operation every expedient by which Ignorance may be superseded by Knowledge, Idleness by Industry, and Suffering by Benevolence;|English
LJ007-0173|that in the metropolis of this highly-favored country, to which the eyes of other lands turn for example, a system of prison discipline such as that enforced in Newgate|English
LJ007-0174|should be for a number of years in undisturbed operation, not only in contempt of religion and humanity,|English
LJ007-0175|but in opposition to the recorded denunciations of authority, and in defiance of the express enactments of the law,|English
LJ007-0176|is indeed a subject which cannot but impress every considerate mind with humiliation and sorrow.|English
LJ007-0177|We trust, however, that the day is at hand when this stain will be removed from the character of the city of London,|English
LJ007-0178|and when the first municipal authority of our land will be no longer subjected to the reproach of fostering an institution which outrages the rights and feelings of humanity,|English
LJ007-0179|defeats the ends of justice, and disgraces the profession of a Christian country.|English
LJ007-0180|The publication of this report raised a storm in the city, and the corporation was roused to make an immediate protest.|English
LJ007-0181|A committee of aldermen was forthwith appointed to report upon the inspectors' report,|English
LJ007-0182|and the result was another lengthy blue book, printed in the parliamentary papers, eighteen thirty-six,|English
LJ007-0183|traversing where it was possible the statements of the inspectors, and offering explanation and palliation of such evils as could not be denied.|English
LJ007-0184|The inspectors retorted without loss of time, reiterating their charges, and pointing out that the committee of aldermen by its own admission|English
LJ007-0185|justified the original allegations. It was impossible to deny the indiscriminate association; the gambling, drinking, smoking, quarreling in the jail;|English
LJ007-0186|the undue authority given to prisoners, the levying of garnish under another name|English
LJ007-0187|the neglect of the condemned convicts, the filthy condition of the wards, the insufficiency of bedding and clothing,|English
LJ007-0188|the misemployment of officers and prisoners by the governor.|English
LJ007-0189|The corporation evidently had the worst of it, and began to feel the necessity for undertaking the great work of reform.|English
LJ007-0190|"Next year we find the inspectors expressing their satisfaction that ""the full and faithful exposure which we felt it our duty to make of Newgate"|English
LJ007-0191|has been productive of at least some advantage,|English
LJ007-0192|inasmuch as it has aroused the attention of those upon whom parliamentary reports and grand jury presentments had hitherto failed to make the slightest impression.|English
LJ007-0193|The measures of improvement introduced were mainly as follows:|English
LJ007-0194|"the fixing of ""inspection holes"" in the doors and walls, so as to insure more supervision; of windows opening into the well-holes,"|English
LJ007-0195|to give better light and ventilation; the construction of bed-places, three tiers high alongside the walls for males, two tiers for females;|English
LJ007-0196|the provision of dining-rooms and dining-tables.|English
LJ007-0197|The infirmary was enlarged, the admission of visitors limited, and the passing of articles prevented by a wire screen.|English
LJ007-0198|The windows were to be glazed and painted to prevent prisoners from looking out;|English
LJ007-0199|baths, fumigating places for clothing, wash-house, and the removal of dust-bins, completed the new arrangements in the main prison.|English
LJ007-0200|In the press-yard, the press-room and ward above it were parceled out into nine separate sleeping cells;|English
LJ007-0201|each was provided with an iron bedstead, and a small desk at which the condemned man might read or write.|English
LJ007-0202|But the one great and most crying evil remained unremedied.|English
LJ007-0203|The mischief of jail associations, say the inspectors,|English
LJ007-0204||English
LJ007-0205|is not only permitted still to exist in the prison, but is rendered more powerful than before.|English
LJ007-0206|In endeavoring to arrest contamination, prisoners were more closely confined, and associated in smaller numbers;|English
LJ007-0207|but this had the effect of throwing them into closer contact, and of making them more intimately acquainted with, more directly influential upon, one another.|English
LJ007-0208|In the inspectors' fourth report, dated eighteen thirty-nine,|English
LJ007-0209|they return to the charge, and again call the corporation to task for their mismanagement of Newgate.|English
LJ007-0210|Abuses and irregularities, which had been partially remedied by the reform introduced in eighteen thirty-seven, were once more in the ascendant.|English
LJ007-0211|"In our late visits, they say, ""we have seen manifest indications of a retrograde movement in this respect,"|English
LJ007-0212|"and a tendency to return to much of that laxity and remissness which formerly marked the management of this prison."""|English
LJ007-0213|Again the following year the inspectors repeat their charge.|English
LJ007-0214||English
LJ007-0215|are the association of prisoners, and the unusual contamination to which such association gives rise.|English
LJ007-0216|For nearly twenty-two hours out of the twenty-four the prisoners are locked up, during which time no officer is stationed in the ward with them.|English
LJ007-0217|They go on to say|English
LJ007-0218|Newgate is only less extensively injurious than formerly because it is less crowded.|English
LJ007-0219|The effects of the imprisonment are to vitiate its inmates, to extend their acquaintanceship with each other,|English
LJ007-0220|to corrupt the prisoner charged with an offense of which he may be innocent, and to confirm in guilt the young and inexperienced offender.|English
LJ007-0221|The reports as the years flow on reiterate the same complaints.|English
LJ007-0222|Much bitterness of feeling is evidently engendered, and the corporation grows more and more angry with the inspectors.|English
LJ007-0223|The prison officials appear to be on the side of the inspectors, to the great dissatisfaction of the corporation, who claimed the full allegiance and support of its servants.|English
LJ007-0224|In a resolution passed by the Court of Aldermen on eighteenth March, eighteen forty-two,|English
LJ007-0225|"I find it ordered ""that the ordinary of Newgate be restricted from making any communications to the Home Office"|English
LJ007-0226|or the Inspectors of Prisons, and that he be required wholly to confine himself to the performance of his duty as prescribed by Act of Parliament.|English
LJ007-0227|The inspectors were not to be deterred, however, by any opposition from the earnest discharge of their functions, and continued to report against Newgate.|English
LJ007-0228|In their tenth report|English
LJ007-0229|they state that they are compelled by an imperative sense of duty to advert in terms of decided condemnation to the lamentable condition of the prisons of the city of London,|English
LJ007-0230|Newgate, Giltspur St. Compter, and the City Bridewell,|English
LJ007-0231|in which the master evil of jail association and consequent contamination still continues to operate directly to the encouragement of crime.|English
LJ007-0232|The plan adopted for ventilating the dining-room on the 'master's side' and that of the middle yard is very inefficient;|English
LJ007-0233|it consists of several circular perforations, about two inches in diameter,|English
LJ007-0234|slanting downwards from the top of the walls to the outside adjoining the slaughterhouses of Newgate market; and occasionally, in hot weather,|English
LJ007-0235|instead of ventilating the apartments, they only serve to convey the offensive effluvia arising from the decaying animal matter into the dining-rooms.|English
LJ007-0236|Sometimes the stench in hot weather is said to be very bad.|English
LJ007-0237|Many rats also come through these so-called ventilators, as they open close to the ground at the back of the prison.|English
LJ007-0238|At the same time the inspectors animadvert strongly upon the misconduct of prisoners and the frequency of prison punishments,|English
LJ007-0239|both offenses and punishments affording a sufficient index to the practices going forward; and they wind up by declaring|English
LJ007-0240|"that a strict compliance with their duties gave them no choice ""but to report matters as we found them,"|English
LJ007-0241|and again and again to protest against Newgate as it at present exists.|English
LJ007-0242|No complete and permanent improvement was indeed possible while Newgate remained unchanged.|English
LJ007-0243|It was not till the erection of the new prison at Holloway in eighteen fifty, and the entire internal reconstruction of Newgate according to new ideas,|English
LJ008-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section eleven: Executions, part one.|English
LJ008-0002|I propose to return now to the subject of Newgate executions,|English
LJ008-0003|which we left at the time of the discontinuance of the long-practiced procession to Tyburn.|English
LJ008-0004|The reasons for this change were fully set forth in a previous chapter.|English
LJ008-0005|The terrible spectacle was as demoralizing to the public, for whose admonition it was intended,|English
LJ008-0006|as the exposure was brutal and cruel towards the principal actors.|English
LJ008-0007|The decision to remove the scene of action to the immediate front of the jail itself|English
LJ008-0008|was in the right direction, as making the performance shorter and diminishing the area of display.|English
LJ008-0009|But the Old Bailey was not exclusively used;|English
LJ008-0010|at first, and for some few years after seventeen eighty-four, executions took place occasionally at a distance from Newgate.|English
LJ008-0011|This was partly due to the survival of the old notion that the scene of the crime ought also to witness the retribution;|English
LJ008-0012|partly perhaps because residents in and about the Old Bailey raised a loud protest against the constant erection of the scaffold in their neighborhood.|English
LJ008-0013|As regards the first, I find that in seventeen eighty-six|English
LJ008-0014|John Hogan, the murderer of a Mr. Odell, an attorney who resided in Charlotte Street, Rathbone Place,|English
LJ008-0015|was executed on a gibbet in front of his victim's house.|English
LJ008-0016|Lawrence Jones, a burglar, was in seventeen ninety-three ordered for execution in Hatton Garden, near the house he had robbed;|English
LJ008-0017|and when he evaded the sentence by suicide, his body was exhibited in the same neighborhood,|English
LJ008-0018|extended upon a plank on the top of an open cart, in his clothes, and fettered.|English
LJ008-0019|Again, as late as eighteen oh nine and eighteen twelve, Execution Dock, on the banks of the Thames, was still retained.|English
LJ008-0020|Here John Sutherland, commander of the British armed transport 'The Friends,' suffered on the twenty-ninth June, eighteen oh nine,|English
LJ008-0021|for the murder of his cabin-boy, whom he stabbed after much ill-usage on board the ship as it lay in the Tagus.|English
LJ008-0022|On the eighteenth December, eighteen twelve,|English
LJ008-0023|two sailors, Charles Palm and Sam Tilling, were hanged at the same place for the murder of their captain, James Keith|English
LJ008-0024|of the trading vessel 'Adventure,' upon the high seas.|English
LJ008-0025|They were taken in a cart to the place of execution, amidst a vast concourse of people.|English
LJ008-0026|Palm, as soon as he was seated in the cart,|English
LJ008-0027|put a quid of tobacco into his mouth, and offered another to his companion, who refused it with indignation|English
LJ008-0028|Some indications of pity were offered for the fate of Tilling; Palm, execration alone.|English
LJ008-0029|But the Old Bailey gradually, and in spite of all objections urged, monopolized the dread business of execution.|English
LJ008-0030|The first affair of the kind on this spot was on the third December, seventeen eighty-three,|English
LJ008-0031|when, in pursuance of an order issued by the Recorder to the sheriffs of Middlesex and the keeper of His Majesty's jail, Newgate,|English
LJ008-0032|a scaffold was erected in front of that prison for the execution of several convicts named by the Recorder.|English
LJ008-0033|Ten were executed|English
LJ008-0034|the scaffold hung with black; and the inhabitants of the neighborhood, having petitioned the sheriffs to remove the scene of execution to the old place,|English
LJ008-0035|were told that the plan had been well considered, and would be persevered in.|English
LJ008-0036|The following twenty-third April, it is stated that the malefactors ordered for execution on the eighteenth instead|English
LJ008-0037|were brought out of Newgate about eight in the morning, and suspended on a gallows of a new construction.|English
LJ008-0038|After hanging the usual time they were taken down, and the machine cleared away in half-an-hour.|English
LJ008-0039|By practice the art is much improved, and there is no part of the world in which villains are hanged in so neat a manner, and with so little ceremony.|English
LJ008-0040|A full description of this new gallows, which was erected in front of the debtors' door, is to be found in contemporary records.|English
LJ008-0041|The criminals are not exposed to view till they mount the fatal stage. The last part of the stage, or that next to the jail,|English
LJ008-0042|is enclosed by a temporary roof, under which are placed two seats for the reception of the sheriffs, one on each side of the stairs leading to the scaffold.|English
LJ008-0043|Round the north, west, and south sides are erected galleries for the reception of officers, attendants, etc.|English
LJ008-0044|and at the distance of five feet from the same is fixed a strong railing all round the scaffold to enclose a place for the constables.|English
LJ008-0045|In the middle of this machinery is placed a movable platform, in form of a trap-door, ten feet long by eight wide,|English
LJ008-0046|on the middle of which is placed the gibbet, extending from the jail across the Old Bailey.|English
LJ008-0047|This movable platform is raised six inches higher than the rest of the scaffold, and on it the convicts stand;|English
LJ008-0048|it is supported by two beams, which are held in their place by bolts. The movement of the lever withdraws the bolts, the platform falls in;|English
LJ008-0049|and this, being much more sudden and regular than that of a cart being drawn away, has the effect of immediate death.|English
LJ008-0050|A broadsheet dated April twenty-fourth, seventeen eighty-seven, describing an execution on the newly-invented scaffold before the debtors' door,|English
LJ008-0051|"says, ""The scaffold on which these miserable people suffered is a temporary machine which was drawn out of the yard of the sessions house by horses;"|English
LJ008-0052|it is supported by strong posts fixed into grooves made in the street;|English
LJ008-0053|"the whole is temporary, being all calculated to take to pieces, which are preserved within the prison."""|English
LJ008-0054|This contrivance appears to have been copied with improvements from that which had been used in Dublin at a still earlier date,|English
LJ008-0055|for that city claims the priority in establishing the custom of hanging criminals at the jail itself.|English
LJ008-0056|"The Dublin ""engine of death,"" as the gallows are styled in the account from which the following description is taken, consisted of an iron bar"|English
LJ008-0057|parallel to the prison wall, and about four feet from it, but strongly affixed thereto with iron scroll clamps.|English
LJ008-0058|From this bar hang several iron loops, in which the halters are tied.|English
LJ008-0059|Under this bar at a proper distance is a piece of flooring or platform,|English
LJ008-0060|projecting somewhat beyond the range of the iron bar, and swinging upon hinges affixed to the wall.|English
LJ008-0061|The entrance upon this floor or leaf is from the middle window over the gate of the prison;|English
LJ008-0062|and this floor is supported below,|English
LJ008-0063|while the criminals stand upon it, by two pieces of timber, which are made to slide in and out of the prison wall through apertures made for that purpose.|English
LJ008-0064|When the criminals are tied up and prepared for their fate, this floor suddenly falls down, upon withdrawing the supporters inwards.|English
LJ008-0065|They are both drawn at once by a windlass, and the unhappy culprits remain suspended.|English
LJ008-0066|"This mode of execution, it is alleged, gave rise to the old vulgar ""chaff,"" ""Take care, or you'll die at the fall of the leaf."""|English
LJ008-0067|The machinery in use in Dublin is much the same as that employed at many jails now-a-days.|English
LJ008-0068|But the fall apart and inwards of two leaves is considered superior.|English
LJ008-0069|The latter is the method still followed at Newgate.|English
LJ008-0070|The sentences inflicted in front of Newgate were not limited to hanging.|English
LJ008-0071|In the few years which elapsed between the establishment of the gallows at Newgate|English
LJ008-0072|and the abolition of the practice of burning females for petty treason, more than one woman suffered this penalty at the Old Bailey.|English
LJ008-0073|One case is preserved by Catnach,|English
LJ008-0074|"that of Phoebe Harris, who in seventeen eighty-eight was ""barbariously"" executed and burnt before Newgate for coining."|English
LJ008-0075|She is described as a well-made little woman, something more than thirty years of age, of a pale complexion and not disagreeable features.|English
LJ008-0076|When she came out of prison she appeared languid and terrified, and trembled greatly as she advanced to the stake,|English
LJ008-0077|where the apparatus for the punishment she was about to experience|English
LJ008-0078|seemed to strike her mind with horror and consternation, to the exclusion of all power of recollectedness in preparation for the approaching awful moment.|English
LJ008-0079|She walked from the debtors' door to a stake fixed in the ground about half-way between the scaffold and Newgate Street.|English
LJ008-0080|She was immediately tied by the neck to an iron bolt fixed near the top of the stake,|English
LJ008-0081|and after praying fervently for a few minutes, the steps on which she stood were drawn away, and she was left suspended.|English
LJ008-0082|A chain fastened by nails to the stake was then put round her body by the executioner with his assistants.|English
LJ008-0083|Two cart-loads of faggots were piled about her, and after she had hung for half-an-hour the fire was kindled.|English
LJ008-0084|The flames presently burned the halter, the body fell a few inches, and hung then by the iron chain.|English
LJ008-0085|The fire had not quite burnt out at twelve, in nearly four hours, that is to say.|English
LJ008-0086|A great concourse of people attended on this melancholy occasion.|English
LJ008-0087|The change from Tyburn to the Old Bailey had worked no improvement as regards the gathering together of the crowd or its demeanor.|English
LJ008-0088|As many spectators as ever thronged to see the dreadful show,|English
LJ008-0089|and they were packed into a more limited space, disporting themselves as heretofore by brutal horse-play, coarse jests, and frantic yells.|English
LJ008-0090|It was still the custom to offer warm encouragement or bitter disapproval, according to the character and antecedents of the sufferer.|English
LJ008-0091|The highwayman, whose exploits many in the crowd admired or emulated, was cheered and bidden to die game;|English
LJ008-0092|the man of better birth could hope for no sympathy, whatever his crime.|English
LJ008-0093|At the execution of Governor Wall, in eighteen oh two, the furious hatred of the mob was plainly apparent in their appalling cries.|English
LJ008-0094|"His appearance on the scaffold was the signal for three prolonged shouts from an innumerable populace, ""the brutal effusion of one common sentiment."""|English
LJ008-0095|It was said that so large a crowd had never collected since the execution of Mrs. Brownrigg, nor had the public indignation risen so high.|English
LJ008-0096|Pieman and ballad-monger did their usual roaring trade amidst the dense throng.|English
LJ008-0097|"No sooner was the ""job"" finished than half-a-dozen competitors appeared, each offering the identical rope for sale at a shilling an inch."|English
LJ008-0098|"One was the ""yeoman of the halter,"" a Newgate official, the executioner's assistant, whom Mr. J. T. Smith, who was present at the execution,"|English
LJ008-0099|"describes as ""a most diabolical-looking little wretch -- Jack Ketch's head man."|English
LJ008-0100|"The yeoman was, however, under-sold by his wife, ""Rosy Emma,"""|English
LJ008-0101|exuberant in talk and hissing hot from Pie Corner, where she had taken her morning dose of gin-and-bitters.|English
LJ008-0102|"A little further off, says Mr. Smith, was ""a lath of a fellow past three-score years and ten,"|English
LJ008-0103|who had just arrived from the purlieus of Black Boy Alley, woebegone as Romeo's apothecary, exclaiming,|English
LJ008-0104|Here's the identical rope at sixpence an inch.|English
LJ008-0105|Mr. Smith's account of the condemned convict, whose cell he was permitted to enter, may be inserted here.|English
LJ008-0106|He was introduced by the ordinary, Dr. Forde, a name familiar to the reader, who met him at the felons' door|English
LJ008-0107|in his canonicals, and with his head as stiffly erect as a sheriff's coachman.|English
LJ008-0108|"The ordinary ""gravely uttered, 'Come this way, Mr. Smith.'"|English
LJ008-0109|As we crossed the press yard a cock crew, and the solitary clanking of a restless chain was dreadfully horrible.|English
LJ008-0110|The prisoners had not risen.|English
LJ008-0111|"They entered a ""stone cold room,"" and were presently joined by the prisoner."|English
LJ008-0112|He was death's counterfeit, tall, shriveled, and pale;|English
LJ008-0113|and his soul shot out so piercingly through the port-holes of his head, that the first glance of him nearly petrified me|English
LJ008-0114|His hands were clasped, and he was truly penitent.|English
LJ008-0115|After the yeoman had requested him to stand up, 'he pinioned him,' as the Newgate phrase is|English
LJ008-0116|and tied the cord with so little feeling that the governor (Wall), who had not given the wretch his accustomed fee, observed,|English
LJ008-0117|You have tied me very tight, upon which Dr. Forde ordered him to slacken the cord, which he did, but not without muttering.|English
LJ008-0118|"Thank you, sir, said the governor to the doctor, ""it is of little moment."""|English
LJ008-0119|He then made some observations to the attendant about the fire, and turning to the doctor, questioned him.|English
LJ008-0120|Do tell me, sir; I am informed I shall go down with great force; is it so?|English
LJ008-0121|After the construction and action of the machine had been explained, the doctor asked the governor what kind of men he had commanded at Goree,|English
LJ008-0122|where the murder for which he was condemned had been committed.|English
LJ008-0123|"Sir, he answered, ""they sent me the very riff-raff."""|English
LJ008-0124|The poor soul then joined the doctor in prayer, and never did I witness more contrition at any condemned sermon than he then evinced.|English
LJ008-0125|The sheriff arrived, attended by his officers, to receive the prisoner from the keeper.|English
LJ008-0126|A new hat was partly flattened on his head, for, owing to its being too small in the crown, it stood many inches too high behind.|English
LJ008-0127|As we were crossing the press yard,|English
LJ008-0128|"the dreadful execrations of some of the felons so shook his frame that he observed ""the clock had struck;"" and quickening his pace,"|English
LJ008-0129|he soon arrived at the room where the sheriff was to give a receipt for his body, according to the usual custom.|English
LJ008-0130|Before the colonel had been pinioned he had pulled out two white handkerchiefs, one of which he bound over his temples so as nearly to conceal his eyes,|English
LJ008-0131|the other he kept between his hands.|English
LJ008-0132|Over the handkerchief around his brows he placed a white cap, the new hat being on top of all.|English
LJ008-0133|He was dressed in a mixed-colored loose coat with a black collar, swandown waistcoat, blue pantaloons, and white silk stockings.|English
LJ008-0134|Thus appareled he ascended the stairs at the debtors' door,|English
LJ008-0135|and stepped out on to the platform, to be received, as has been said, by prolonged yells.|English
LJ008-0136|These evidently deprived him of the small portion of fortitude he had summoned up.|English
LJ008-0137|He bowed his head under extreme pressure of ignominy,|English
LJ008-0138|and at his request the ordinary drew the cap further down over his face, when in an instant,|English
LJ008-0139|without waiting for any signal, the platform dropped, and he was launched into eternity.|English
LJ008-0140|Whenever the public attention had been specially called to a particular crime, either on account of its atrocity,|English
LJ008-0141|the doubtfulness of the issue, or the superior position of the perpetrator,|English
LJ008-0142|the attendance at the execution was certain to be tumultuous, and the conduct of the mob disorderly.|English
LJ008-0143|This was notably the case at the execution of Holloway and Haggerty|English
LJ008-0144|in eighteen oh seven, an event long remembered from the fatal and disastrous consequences which followed it.|English
LJ008-0145|They were accused by a confederate, who, goaded by conscience, had turned approver, of the murder of a Mr. Steele,|English
LJ008-0146|who kept a lavender warehouse in the city, and who had gardens at Feltham,|English
LJ008-0147|whither he often went to distill the lavender, returning to London the same evening.|English
LJ008-0148|One night he was missing|English
LJ008-0149|and after a long interval his dead body was discovered, shockingly disfigured, in a ditch. This was in eighteen oh two.|English
LJ008-0150|Four years passed without the detection of the murderers,|English
LJ008-0151|but in the beginning of eighteen oh seven one of them, at that time just sentenced to transportation,|English
LJ008-0152|made a full confession, and implicated Holloway and Haggerty.|English
LJ008-0153|They were accordingly apprehended and brought to trial, the informer, Hanfield by name, being accepted as king's evidence.|English
LJ008-0154|Conviction followed mainly on his testimony; but the two men, especially Holloway, stoutly maintained their innocence to the last.|English
LJ008-0155|Very great excitement prevailed in the town throughout the trial, and this greatly increased when the verdict was known.|English
LJ008-0156|An enormous crowd assembled to witness the execution, amounting, it was said, to the hitherto unparalleled number of forty thousand.|English
LJ008-0157|By eight o'clock not an inch of ground in front of the platform was unoccupied.|English
LJ008-0158|The pressure soon became so frightful that many would have willingly escaped from the crowd; but their attempts only increased the general confusion.|English
LJ008-0159|Very soon women began to scream with terror;|English
LJ008-0160|some, especially of low stature, found it difficult to remain standing, and several, although held up for some time by the men nearest them,|English
LJ008-0161|presently fell, and were at once trampled to death.|English
LJ008-0162|Cries of Murder! murder! were now raised, and added greatly to the horrors of the scene.|English
LJ008-0163|Panic became general. More women, children, and many men were borne down, to perish beneath the feet of the rest.|English
LJ008-0164|The most affecting and distressing scene was at Green Arbor Lane, just opposite the debtors' door of the prison.|English
LJ008-0165|Here a couple of piemen had been selling their wares; the basket of one of them, which was raised upon a four-legged stool, was upset.|English
LJ008-0166|The pieman stooped down to pick up his scattered stock, and some of the mob, not seeing what had happened, stumbled over him.|English
LJ008-0167|No one who fell ever rose again.|English
LJ008-0168|Among the rest was a woman with an infant at the breast.|English
LJ008-0169|She was killed, but in the act of falling she forced her child into the arms of a man near her, and implored him in God's name to save it;|English
LJ008-0170|the man, needing all his care for his own life, threw the child from him,|English
LJ008-0171|and it passed along the heads of the crowd, to be caught at last by a person who struggled with it to a cart and deposited it there in safety.|English
LJ008-0172|In another part seven persons met their death by suffocation.|English
LJ008-0173|In this convulsive struggle for bare existence people fought fiercely with one another, and the weakest, of course the women, went under.|English
LJ008-0174|One cart-load of spectators having broken down, some of its occupants fell off the vehicle, and were instantly trampled to death.|English
LJ008-0175|This went on for more than an hour, and until the malefactors were cut down and the gallows removed;|English
LJ008-0176|then the mob began to thin, and the streets were cleared by the city marshals and a number of constables.|English
LJ008-0177|The catastrophe exceeded the worst anticipations. Nearly one hundred dead and dying lay about; and after all had been removed,|English
LJ008-0178|the bodies for identification, the wounded to hospitals, a cart-load of shoes, hats, petticoats, and fragments of wearing apparel were picked up.|English
LJ008-0180|Among the dead was a sailor lad whom no one knew;|English
LJ008-0181|he had his pockets filled with bread and cheese, and it was generally supposed that he had come a long distance to see the fatal show.|English
LJ008-0182|A tremendous crowd assembled when Bellingham was executed in eighteen twelve for the murder of Spencer Percival, at that time prime minister;|English
LJ008-0183|but there were no serious accidents, beyond those caused by the goring of a maddened, over-driven ox which forced its way through the crowd.|English
LJ008-0184|Precautions had been taken by the erection of barriers, and the posting of placards at all the avenues to the Old Bailey, on which was printed,|English
LJ008-0185|Beware of entering the crowd! Remember thirty poor persons were pressed to death by the crowd when Haggerty and Holloway were executed!|English
LJ008-0186|The concourse was very great, notwithstanding these warnings.|English
LJ008-0187|It was still greater at Fauntleroy's execution in eighteen twenty-four, when no less than one hundred thousand persons assembled, it was said.|English
LJ008-0188|Every window and roof which could command a view of the horrible performance was occupied.|English
LJ008-0189|All the avenues and approaches, places even whence nothing whatever could be seen of the scaffold,|English
LJ008-0190|were blocked by persons who had overflowed from the area in front of the jail.|English
LJ008-0191|At Courvoisier's execution in eighteen forty it was the same, or worse.|English
LJ008-0192|As early as six a.m. the number assembled already exceeded that seen on ordinary occasions;|English
LJ008-0193|by seven a.m. the whole space was so thronged that it was impossible to move one way or the other.|English
LJ008-0194|Some persons were kept for more than five hours standing against the barriers, and many nearly fainted from exhaustion.|English
LJ008-0195|Every window had its party of occupants; the adjoining roofs were equally crowded.|English
LJ008-0196|High prices were asked and paid for front seats or good standing room. As much as five pounds was given for the attic story|English
LJ008-0197|of the Lamb's Coffee House;|English
LJ008-0198|two pounds was a common price for a window.|English
LJ008-0199|At the George public-house to the south of the drop, Sir W. Watkin Wynn, Baronet,|English
LJ008-0200|hired a room for the night and morning, which he and a large party of friends occupied before and during the execution;|English
LJ008-0201|in an adjoining house, that of an undertaker, was Lord Alfred Paget, also with several friends.|English
LJ008-0202|Those who had hired apartments spent the night in them, keeping up their courage with liquids and cigars.|English
LJ008-0203|Numbers of ladies were present, although the public feeling was much against their attendance.|English
LJ008-0204|One well-dressed woman fell out of a first-floor window on to the shoulders of the crowd below, but neither she nor any one else was greatly hurt.|English
LJ008-0205|The city authorities had endeavored to take all precautions against panic and excitement among the crowd,|English
LJ008-0206|and caused a number of stout additional barriers to be erected in front of the scaffold,|English
LJ008-0207|and although one of these gave way owing to the extraordinary pressure, no serious accident occurred.|English
LJ008-0208|Some years later an eye-witness published a graphic account of one of these scenes.|English
LJ008-0209|Soon after midnight on the Sunday night, for by this time the present practice of executing on Monday morning had been pretty generally introduced,|English
LJ008-0210|the crowd began to congregate in and about the Old Bailey.|English
LJ008-0211|Gin-shops and coffee-houses were the first to open doors, and touts began to bid for tenants for the various rooms upstairs.|English
LJ008-0212|"Cries of ""Comfortable room!"" ""Excellent situation!"" ""Beautiful prospect!"" ""Splendid view!"" resounded on every side."|English
LJ008-0213|By this time the workmen might be heard busily erecting the gallows;|English
LJ008-0214|the sounds of hammer and saw intermingled with the broad jeers and coarse jests of the rapidly increasing mob.|English
LJ008-0215|One by one the huge uprights of black timber were fitted together,|English
LJ008-0216|until presently the huge stage loomed dark above the crowd which was now ranged round the barriers;|English
LJ008-0217|a throng of people whom neither rain, snow, storm, nor darkness ever hindered from attending the show.|English
LJ008-0218|They were mainly members of the criminal classes.|English
LJ008-0219|their conversation was of companions and associates of former years, long ago imprisoned, transported, hanged, while they,|English
LJ008-0220|hoary-headed and hardened in guilt, were still at large.|English
LJ008-0221|They talked of the days when the convicts were hung up a dozen or more in a row;|English
LJ008-0222|of those who had shown the white, and those who had died game.|English
LJ008-0223|"The approaching ceremony had evidently no terrors for these ""idolaters of the gallows."""|English
LJ008-0224|With them were younger men and women:|English
LJ008-0225|the former already vowed to the same criminal career, and looking up to their elders with the respect due to successful practitioners;|English
LJ008-0226|the latter unsexed and brutalized by dissipation,|English
LJ008-0227|slipshod and slovenly, in crushed bonnet and dirty shawl, the gown fastened by a single hook,|English
LJ008-0228|their harsh and half-cracked voices full of maudlin, besotted sympathy for those about to die.|English
LJ008-0229|Above the murmur and tumult of that noisy assembly, the lowing and bleating of cattle as they were driven into the stalls and pens of Smithfield|English
LJ008-0230|fell with a strange unnatural sound upon the ear|English
LJ008-0231|Hush! the unceasing murmur of the mob now breaks into a loud deep roar,|English
LJ008-0232|a sound as if the ocean had suddenly broken through some ancient boundary, against which its ever restless billows had for ages battered;|English
LJ008-0233|the wide dark sea of heads is all at once in motion;|English
LJ008-0234|each wave seems trying to overleap the other as they are drawn onwards towards this outlet.|English
LJ008-0235|Every link in that great human chain is shaken, along the whole lengthened line has the motion jarred, and each in turn sees,|English
LJ008-0236|coiled up on the floor of the scaffold like a serpent, the hangman's rope!|English
LJ008-0237|The human hand that placed it there was only seen for a moment,|English
LJ008-0238|as it lay, white and ghastly, upon the black boards, and then again was as suddenly withdrawn, as if ashamed of the deed it had done.|English
LJ008-0239|The loud shout of the multitude once more subsided, or only fell upon the abstracted ear like the dreamy murmur of an ocean shell.|English
LJ008-0240|Then followed sounds more distinct and audible, in which ginger-beer, pies, fried fish, sandwiches, and fruit|English
LJ008-0241|were vended under the names of notorious murderers, highwaymen, and criminals,|English
LJ008-0242|famous in the annals of Newgate for the hardihood they had displayed in the hour of execution, when they terminated their career of crime at the gallows.|English
LJ008-0243|Threading his way among these itinerant vendors was seen the meek-faced deliverer of tracts, the man of good intentions, now bonneted,|English
LJ008-0244|now laughed at, the skirt of his seedy black coat torn across; yet,|English
LJ008-0245|though pulled right and left, or sent headlong into the crowd by the swing of some brutal and muscular arm,|English
LJ008-0246|Never once from that pale face passed away its benign and patient expression.|English
LJ008-0247|but ever the same form moved along in the fulfillment of his mission, in spite of all persecution.|English
LJ008-0248|Another fight followed the score which had already taken place; this time two women were the combatants.|English
LJ008-0249|Blinded with their long hair, they tore at each other like two furies; their bonnets and caps were trodden underfoot in the kennel,|English
LJ008-0250|and lay disregarded beside the body of the poor dog which, while searching for its master in the crowd,|English
LJ008-0251|was an hour before kicked to death by the savage and brutal mob.|English
LJ008-0252|Another deep roar, louder than any which had preceded it, broke from the multitude.|English
LJ008-0253|Then came the cry of 'Hats off!' and 'Down in front!' as at a theatre.|English
LJ008-0254|It was followed by the deep and solemn booming of the death-bell from the church of St. Sepulchre|English
LJ008-0255|the iron knell that rang upon the beating heart of the living man who was about to die;|English
LJ008-0256|and with blanched cheek, and sinking, we turned away from the scene.|English
LJ008-0257|In thus describing the saturnalia before the gallows I have been drawn on somewhat beyond the period with which I am at present dealing.|English
LJ008-0258|Let me retrace my steps, and speak more in detail of the treatment of the condemned in those bloodthirsty and brutally indifferent days,|English
LJ008-0259|and of their demeanor after sentence until the last penalty was paid.|English
LJ008-0260|One of the worst evils was the terrible and long-protracted uncertainty as to the result.|English
LJ008-0261|In the case of convicted murderers only was prompt punishment inflicted,|English
LJ008-0262|and with them indeed this dispatch amounted to undue precipitancy.|English
LJ008-0263|Forty-eight hours was the limit of time allowed to the unhappy man to make his peace, and during that time he was still kept on a bare allowance of bread and water.|English
LJ008-0264|But the murderers formed only a small proportion of the total number sentenced to death, and for the rest there was a long period of anxious suspense,|English
LJ008-0265|although in the long run mercy generally prevailed, and very few capitally convicted for crimes less than murder actually suffered.|English
LJ008-0266|Thus in the years between May first, eighteen twenty-seven, and thirtieth April, eighteen thirty-one,|English
LJ008-0267|no less than four hundred and fifty-one sentences of death for capital crimes were passed at the Old Bailey;|English
LJ008-0268|but of these three hundred and ninety-six were reversed by the king in council, and only fifty-two were really executed.|English
LJ008-0269|Already the severity of our criminal code, and the number of capital felonies upon the statute book, had brought a reaction;|English
LJ008-0270|and while the courts adhered to the letter of the law, appeals were constantly made to the royal prerogative of mercy.|English
LJ008-0271|This was more particularly the practice in London.|English
LJ008-0272|Judges on assize were satisfied with simply recording a sentence of death against offenders whom they did not think deserved the extreme penalty.|English
LJ008-0273|At the Old Bailey almost every one capitally convicted by a jury was sentenced to be hanged.|English
LJ008-0274|The result in the latter case was left in the first place to the king in council,|English
LJ008-0275|but there was a further appeal then, as now, to the king himself, or practically to the Home Secretary.|English
LJ008-0276|Neither in town or country were cases entirely taken on their own merits.|English
LJ008-0277|Convicted offenders might have good or bad luck; they might be arraigned when their particular crime was uncommon, and were then nearly certain to escape;|English
LJ008-0278|"or theirs might be one of many, and it might be considered necessary to ""make an example."""|English
LJ008-0279|In this latter it might fairly be said that a man was put to death less for his own sins than for the crimes of others.|English
LJ008-0280|The absurdity of the system, its irregularity and cruelty, were fully touched upon by the inspectors of prisons in their first report.|English
LJ008-0281|They found at Newgate, under disgraceful conditions as already described,|English
LJ008-0282|seventeen capital convicts, upon all of whom the sentence of death had been passed. Eventually two only of the whole number suffered;|English
LJ008-0283|two others were sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and the balance to varying terms.|English
LJ008-0284|Nothing could be more strongly marked than the contrast between the ultimate destiny of different individuals all abiding the same awful doom:|English
LJ008-0285|on the one hand the gallows, on the other a short imprisonment.|English
LJ008-0286|"The inspectors very properly desired to call attention to the inevitable tendency in this mode of dealing with ""the most awful sanctions of the law,"""|English
LJ008-0287|to make those sanctions an object of contemptuous mockery.|English
LJ008-0288|The consequences were plainly proved to the inspectors.|English
LJ008-0289|"Capitally convicted prisoners did, as a matter of fact, ""treat with habitual and inexpressible levity the sentence of death."""|English
LJ008-0290|Of this I have treated at length in the last chapter.|English
LJ008-0291|The time thus spent varied considerably,|English
LJ008-0292|but it was seldom less than six weeks. It all depended upon the sovereign's disposition to do business.|English
LJ008-0293|Sometimes the Privy Council did not meet for months, and during all that time the convicts languished with hope|English
LJ008-0294|nearly indefinitely deferred.|English
LJ008-0295|"When the council had decided, the news was conveyed to Newgate by the Recorder, who made his ""report,"" as it was called."|English
LJ008-0296|The time of the arrival of this report was generally known at Newgate,|English
LJ008-0297|and its contents were anxiously awaited by both convicts in the press-yard and their friends collected in a crowd outside the gates.|English
LJ008-0298|Sometimes the report was delayed.|English
LJ008-0299|On one occasion, Mr. Wakefield tells us, the Recorder, who had attended the council at Windsor, did not deliver the report till the following day.|English
LJ008-0300|The prisoners and their friends, therefore, were kept in a state of the most violent suspense for many hours,|English
LJ008-0301|during which they counted the moments -- the prisoners in their cells as usual, and their friends in the street in front of Newgate, where they passed the night.|English
LJ008-0302|I have heard the protracted agony of both classes described by those who witnessed it in terms so strong, that I am unwilling to repeat them.|English
LJ008-0303|The crowd of men and women who passed the night in front of Newgate, began, as soon as the hour was passed when they had expected the report,|English
LJ008-0304|to utter imprecations against the Recorder, the Secretary of State, the Council, and the King;|English
LJ008-0305|they never ceased cursing until the passion of anger so excited was exchanged for joy in some and grief in others.|English
LJ008-0306|I myself heard more than one of those whose lives were spared by that decision of the council,|English
LJ008-0307|afterwards express a wish to murder the Recorder for having kept them so long in suspense.|English
LJ008-0308|The Recorder's report generally reached Newgate late at night.|English
LJ008-0309|Its receipt was immediately followed by the promulgation of its contents to the persons most closely concerned,|English
LJ008-0310|which was done with a sort of ceremony intended to be impressive.|English
LJ008-0311|The whole of the convicts were assembled together in one ward, and made to kneel down.|English
LJ008-0312|To them entered the chaplain or ordinary of Newgate in full canonicals,|English
LJ008-0313|who in solemn tones communicated to each in turn the fate in store for him.|English
LJ008-0314|The form of imparting the intelligence was generally the same.|English
LJ008-0315|So-and-so, I am sorry to tell you that it is all against you; or,|English
LJ008-0316|A. B., your case has been taken into consideration by the king in council, and His Majesty has been mercifully pleased to spare your life.|English
LJ008-0317|The fatal news was not always received in the same way.|English
LJ008-0318|The men who were doomed often fell down in convulsions upon the floor.|English
LJ008-0319|Sometimes any who had had a narrow escape fainted, but the bulk of those respited looked on with unfeeling indifference.|English
LJ009-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section twelve: Executions, part two.|English
LJ009-0002|It is satisfactory to be able to record that some consideration was shown the capital convict actually awaiting execution.|English
LJ009-0003|"Even so severe a critic as Mr. Wakefield states that ""a stranger to the scene"|English
LJ009-0004|would be astonished to observe the peculiar tenderness, I was going to add respect,|English
LJ009-0005|which persons under sentence of death obtain from all the officers of the prison.|English
LJ009-0006|Before sentence a prisoner has only to observe the regulations of the jail in order to remain neglected and unnoticed.|English
LJ009-0007|Once ordered to the cells, friends of all classes suddenly rise up; his fellow-prisoners, the turnkeys, the chaplain,|English
LJ009-0008|the keepers, and the sheriffs all seem interested in his fate, and he can make no reasonable request that is not at once granted by whomsoever he may address.|English
LJ009-0009|This rule has some, but very few, exceptions; such as where a hardened offender behaves with great levity and brutality, as if he cared nought for his life,|English
LJ009-0010|and thought every one anxious to promote his death.|English
LJ009-0011|"Mr. Wakefield goes on to remark that persons convicted of forgery ""excited an extraordinary degree of interest in all who approached them."""|English
LJ009-0012|This was noticeable with Fauntleroy, who, on account of his birth and antecedents, was allowed to occupy a turnkey's room,|English
LJ009-0013|and kept altogether separate from the other prisoners until the day of his death.|English
LJ009-0014|It cannot be denied, however, that the ordinary's treatment was somewhat unfeeling, and in proof thereof|English
LJ009-0015|I will quote an extract from the reverend gentleman's own journal.|English
LJ009-0016|He seems to have improved the occasion when preaching the condemned sermon before Fauntleroy, by pointing a moral from that unhappy man's own case.|English
LJ009-0017|For this the chaplain was a few days later summoned before the jail committee of aldermen,|English
LJ009-0018|"and informed that the public would not in future be admitted to hear the condemned sermon. ""I was also informed,"" writes Mr. Cotton,"|English
LJ009-0019|that this resolution was in consequence of their (the aldermen's) disapproving of the last discourse delivered by me,|English
LJ009-0020|previous to the execution of Henry Fauntleroy for uttering a forged security|English
LJ009-0021|in which it was said I had enlarged upon the heinous nature of his crime, and warned the public to avoid such conduct.|English
LJ009-0022|I was informed that this unnecessarily harassed his feelings, and that the object of such sermons was solely to console the prisoner,|English
LJ009-0023|and that from the time of his conviction nothing but what is consolatory should be addressed to a criminal.|English
LJ009-0024|One of the aldermen, moreover, informed me that the whole court of aldermen were unanimous in their opinion on this subject.|English
LJ009-0025|As to the exclusion of strangers on these occasions,|English
LJ009-0026|the experience I have had convinces me that one, and perhaps the only, good of an execution, i. e. the solemn admonition to the public,|English
LJ009-0027|will thereby be lost.|English
LJ009-0028|Probably the reader will side with the aldermen against the ordinary.|English
LJ009-0029|This episode throws some doubt upon the tenderness and proper feeling exhibited by the chaplain towards the most deserving members of his criminal flock;|English
LJ009-0030|and the idea will be strengthened by the following account of the Sunday service in the prison chapel on the occasion when the condemned sermon was preached.|English
LJ009-0031|The extract is from Mr. E. Gibbon Wakefield's brochure, the date eighteen twenty-eight, just three years after Fauntleroy's death.|English
LJ009-0032|Strangers were now excluded, but the sheriffs attended in state, wearing their gold chains,|English
LJ009-0033|while behind their pew stood a couple of tall footmen in state liveries.|English
LJ009-0034|The sheriffs were in one gallery;|English
LJ009-0035|in the other opposite were the convicts capitally convicted who had been respited.|English
LJ009-0036|Down below between the galleries was the mass of the prison population;|English
LJ009-0037|the schoolmaster and the juvenile prisoners being seated round the communion-table, opposite the pulpit.|English
LJ009-0038|In the center of the chapel was the condemned pew, a large dock-like erection painted black.|English
LJ009-0039|Those who sat in it were visible to the whole congregation, and still more to the ordinary,|English
LJ009-0040|whose desk and pulpit were just in front of the condemned pew, and within a couple of yards of it.|English
LJ009-0041|The occupants of this terrible black pew were the last always to enter the chapel.|English
LJ009-0042|Upon the occasion which I am describing they were four in number; and here I will continue the narrative in Mr. Wakefield's own words:|English
LJ009-0043|First is a youth of eighteen, condemned for stealing in a dwelling-house goods valued above five pounds.|English
LJ009-0044|His features have no felonious cast;|English
LJ009-0045|he steps boldly with head upright, looks to the women's gallery, and smiles. His intention is to pass for a brave fellow,|English
LJ009-0046|but the attempt fails; he trembles, his knees knock together, and his head droops as he enters the condemned pew.|English
LJ009-0047|The next convict is clearly and unmistakably a villain.|English
LJ009-0048|He is a hardened offender, previously cast for life, reprieved, transported to Australia, and since returned without pardon.|English
LJ009-0049|For this offense the punishment is death.|English
LJ009-0050|He has, however, doubly earned his sentence, and is actually condemned for burglary committed since his arrival in England.|English
LJ009-0051|His look at the sheriffs and the ordinary is full of scorn and defiance.|English
LJ009-0052|The third convict is a sheep-stealer, a poor ignorant fellow in whose crime are mitigating circumstances,|English
LJ009-0053|but who is left to die on the supposition that this is not his first conviction, and still more because a good many sheep have of late been stolen by other people.|English
LJ009-0054|He is quite content to die;|English
LJ009-0055|indeed the chaplain and others have brought him firmly to believe that his situation is enviable, and that the gates of heaven are open to receive him.|English
LJ009-0056|"The last of the four is said to have been a clergyman of the Church of England, condemned for forgery, ""a miserable old man in a tattered suit of black."|English
LJ009-0057|Already he is half dead.|English
LJ009-0058|Great efforts have been made to save his life.|English
LJ009-0059|Friends, even utter strangers, have interceded for him, and to the last he has buoyed himself up by hope of reprieve.|English
LJ009-0060|Now his doom is sealed irrevocably, and he has given himself up to despair.|English
LJ009-0061|He staggers towards the pew, reels into it, stumbles forward, flings himself on the ground, and, by a curious twist of the spine,|English
LJ009-0062|buries his head under his body.|English
LJ009-0063|The sheriffs shudder, their inquisitive friends crane forward, the keeper frowns on the excited congregation,|English
LJ009-0064|the lately smirking footmen close their eyes and forget their liveries, the ordinary clasps his hands, the turnkeys cry 'Hush!'|English
LJ009-0065|and the old clerk lifts up his cracked voice, saying, 'Let us sing to the praise and glory of God.'|English
LJ009-0066|The morning hymn is sung first, as if to remind the condemned that next morning at eight a.m. they are to die.|English
LJ009-0067|The service proceeds. At last the burial service is reached.|English
LJ009-0068|The youth alone is able to read, but from long want of practice he is at a loss to find the place in his prayer-book.|English
LJ009-0069|The ordinary observes him, looks to the sheriffs, and says aloud, 'The service for the dead!'|English
LJ009-0070|The youth's hands tremble as they hold the book upside down.|English
LJ009-0071|The burglar is heard to mutter an angry oath.|English
LJ009-0072|The sheep-stealer smiles, and, extending his arms upwards, looks with a glad expression to the roof of the chapel.|English
LJ009-0073|The forger has never moved.|English
LJ009-0074|Let us pass on.|English
LJ009-0075|All have sung 'the Lamentation of a Sinner,' and have seemed to pray 'especially for those now awaiting the awful execution of the law.'|English
LJ009-0076|We come to the sermon.|English
LJ009-0077|The ordinary of Newgate is an orthodox, unaffected, Church of England divine,|English
LJ009-0078|who preaches plain, homely discourses, as fit as any religious discourse can be fit for the irritated audience.|English
LJ009-0079|The sermon of this day, whether eloquent or plain, useful or useless, must produce a striking effect at the moment of its delivery.|English
LJ009-0080|The text, without another word, is enough to raise the wildest passions of the audience|English
LJ009-0081|For a while the preacher addresses himself to the congregation at large, who listen attentively|English
LJ009-0082|except the clergyman and the burglar, the former of whom is still rolled up at the bottom of the condemned pew,|English
LJ009-0083|while the eyes of the latter are wandering round the chapel, and one of them is occasionally winked impudently at some acquaintance amongst the prisoners for trial.|English
LJ009-0084|At length the ordinary pauses, and then, in a deep tone, which, though hardly above a whisper, is audible to all, says,|English
LJ009-0085|'Now for you, my poor fellow mortals, who are about to suffer the last penalty of the law.'|English
LJ009-0086|But why should I repeat the whole?|English
LJ009-0087|It is enough to say that in the same solemn tone he talks about the minutest of crimes, punishments, bonds, shame,|English
LJ009-0088|ignominy, sorrow, sufferings, wretchedness, pangs,|English
LJ009-0089|childless parents, widows and helpless orphans, broken and contrite hearts, and death tomorrow morning for the benefit of society.|English
LJ009-0090|The dying men are dreadfully agitated.|English
LJ009-0091|The young stealer in a dwelling-house no longer has the least pretense to bravery. He grasps the back of the pew,|English
LJ009-0092|his legs give way, he utters a faint groan, and sinks on the floor.|English
LJ009-0093|Why does no one stir to help him? Where would be the use? The hardened burglar moves not, nor does he speak;|English
LJ009-0094|but his face is of an ashy paleness; and if you look carefully you may see the blood trickling from his lip,|English
LJ009-0095|which he has bitten unconsciously, or from rage, or to rouse his fainting courage.|English
LJ009-0096|The poor sheep-stealer is in a frenzy.|English
LJ009-0097|He throws his hands far from him, and shouts aloud, 'Mercy, good Lord! mercy is all I ask. The Lord in His mercy come!|English
LJ009-0098|There! there! I see the Lamb of God! Oh! how happy! Oh! this is happy!|English
LJ009-0099|Meanwhile the clergyman, still bent into the form of a sleeping dog,|English
LJ009-0100|struggles violently; his feet, legs, hands, and arms, even the muscles of his back,|English
LJ009-0101|move with a quick, jerking motion, not naturally, but, as it were, like the affected parts of a galvanized corpse.|English
LJ009-0102|Suddenly he utters a short sharp scream, and all is still.|English
LJ009-0103|The silence is short. As the ordinary proceeds 'to conclude,'|English
LJ009-0104|the women set up a yell, which is mixed with a rustling noise, occasioned by the removal of those whose hysterics have ended in fainting.|English
LJ009-0105|The sheriffs cover their faces, and one of their inquisitive friends blows his nose with his glove.|English
LJ009-0106|The keeper tries to appear unmoved, but his eye wanders anxiously over the combustible assembly.|English
LJ009-0107|The children round the communion-table stare and gape with childish wonder.|English
LJ009-0108|The two masses of prisoners for trial undulate and slightly murmur,|English
LJ009-0109|while the capital convicts who were lately in that black pew appear faint with emotion.|English
LJ009-0110|This exhibition lasts for some minutes, and then the congregation disperses,|English
LJ009-0111|the condemned returning to the cells: the forger carried by turnkeys; the youth sobbing aloud convulsively, as a passionate child;|English
LJ009-0112|the burglar muttering curses and savage expressions of defiance; whilst the poor sheep-stealer shakes hands with the turnkeys,|English
LJ009-0113|whistles merrily, and points upwards with madness in his look.|English
LJ009-0114|Mr. Wakefield winds up his graphic but somewhat sensational account by describing another religious service, which may appropriately be inserted here.|English
LJ009-0115|"He says, ""On the day of execution there is no service in the chapel of Newgate."|English
LJ009-0116|On the following day the capital convicts, whose companions have been hanged, are required to return thanks for their narrow escape.|English
LJ009-0117|The firmest disbeliever in religion, if he had not lately been irritated by taking part in such a scene as the condemned service in Newgate,|English
LJ009-0118|could hardly witness this ceremony without being affected. The men, who were so lately snatched from the jaws of death,|English
LJ009-0119|kneel, whilst the rest of the congregation sit, and the ordinary, in a tone of peculiar solemnity, says,|English
LJ009-0120|Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks|English
LJ009-0121|for all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us, and to all men;|English
LJ009-0122|particularly to those who desire now to offer up their praises and thanksgivings for thy late mercies vouchsafed unto them.|English
LJ009-0123|Could any one, knowing the late situation of the kneeling men, looking as they do at the empty pew,|English
LJ009-0124|occupied when they saw it last, but a few hours ago, by their comrades who are now dead;|English
LJ009-0125|could any one, not disgusted with the religious ceremonials of Newgate, witness this scene without emotion?|English
LJ009-0126|Hardly any one.|English
LJ009-0127|But what are the feelings of those who take part in it?|English
LJ009-0128|I have been present at the scene not less than twenty times, and have invariably observed|English
LJ009-0129|that many of the kneeling men or boys laughed while they knelt, pinched each other, and, when they could do so without fear of being seen by any officer of the prison,|English
LJ009-0130|winked at other prisoners in derision of what was taking place; and I have frequently heard men and lads who had been of the kneeling party|English
LJ009-0131|boast to their companions after the service that they had wiped their eyes during the thanksgiving, to make the ordinary believe they had been crying.|English
LJ009-0132|Although this misapplication of religious services still went on,|English
LJ009-0133|the outside public continued to be excluded from the Newgate chapel on the day the condemned sermon was preached.|English
LJ009-0134|This very proper rule was, however, set aside on the Sunday preceding Courvoisier's execution.|English
LJ009-0135|So many applications for admission were made to the sheriffs,|English
LJ009-0136|that they reluctantly agreed to open the gallery which had formerly been occupied by strangers on these occasions.|English
LJ009-0137|Cards were issued, and to such an extent, that although the service was not to commence till half-past ten, by nine a.m.|English
LJ009-0138|all the avenues to the prison gates were blocked by ticket-holders.|English
LJ009-0139|In spite of the throng, owing to the excellent arrangements made by the sheriffs,|English
LJ009-0140|no inconvenience was suffered by the congregation, among whom were Lord Adolphus Fitz Clarence, Lord Coventry,|English
LJ009-0141|Lord Paget, Lord Bruce, several members of the House of Commons, and a few ladies.|English
LJ009-0142|Contemporary accounts give a minute description of the demeanor of the convict upon this solemn occasion.|English
LJ009-0143|He sat on a bench before the pulpit, -- the hideous condemned pew had been swept away, -- and never once raised his eyes during the service.|English
LJ009-0144|In fact his looks denoted extreme sorrow and contrition,|English
LJ009-0145|and he seemed to suffer great inward agitation when the ordinary particularly alluded to the crime for the perpetration of which he stood condemned.|English
LJ009-0146|Mr. Carver, the ordinary, appears to have addressed himself directly to Courvoisier,|English
LJ009-0147|and to have dwelt with more emphasis than good taste upon the nature of the crime, and the necessity for repentance.|English
LJ009-0148|But the chaplain admitted that the solitude of the convict's cell|English
LJ009-0149|was more appropriate for serious reflection and profitable ministration than this exciting occasion before a large and public assembly.|English
LJ009-0150|So far as I can find, Courvoisier was the last condemned criminal who was thus exhibited to a crowd of morbidly curious spectators.|English
LJ009-0151|The atrocity of the murder no doubt attracted extraordinary attention to it.|English
LJ009-0152|The crowd outside Newgate on the day of execution has already been described; but there was also a select gathering of distinguished visitors within the jail.|English
LJ009-0153|First came the sheriffs, the under-sheriffs, and several aldermen and city officials, then Lord Powerscourt and several other peers of the realm.|English
LJ009-0154|Mr. Charles Kean the tragedian was also present,|English
LJ009-0155|drawn to this terrible exhibition by the example of his father, the more celebrated Edmund Kean, who had witnessed the execution of Thistlewood|English
LJ009-0156|"with a view, as he himself said, ""to his professional studies."""|English
LJ009-0157|But there is little doubt that as executions became more rare they made more impression on the public mind.|English
LJ009-0158|Already a strong dislike to the reckless and almost indiscriminate application of the extreme penalty was apparent in all classes,|English
LJ009-0159|and the mitigation of the criminal code, for which Romilly had so strenuously labored, was daily more and more of an accomplished fact.|English
LJ009-0160|In eighteen thirty-two|English
LJ009-0161|capital punishment was abolished for forgery, except in cases of forging or altering wills or powers of attorney to transfer stock.|English
LJ009-0162|Nevertheless, after that date no person whatever was executed for this offense.|English
LJ009-0163|In the same year capital punishment was further restricted, and ceased to be the legal sentence for coining,|English
LJ009-0164|sheep or horse stealing, and stealing in a dwelling-house.|English
LJ009-0165|House-breaking, as distinguished from burglary, was similarly exempted in the following year;|English
LJ009-0166|next, the offenses of returning from transportation, stealing post-office letters, and sacrilege were no longer punishable with death.|English
LJ009-0167|In eighteen thirty-seven Lord John Russell's acts swept away a number of capital offenses, including cutting and maiming, rick-burning,|English
LJ009-0168|robbery, burglary, and arson.|English
LJ009-0169|Within a couple of years the number of persons sentenced to death in England had fallen from four hundred and thirty-eight in eighteen thirty-seven|English
LJ009-0170|to fifty-six in eighteen thirty-nine.|English
LJ009-0171|Gradually the application of capital punishment became more and more restricted, and was soon the penalty for murder alone.|English
LJ009-0172|While in London, for instance, in eighteen twenty-nine, twenty-four persons had been executed for crimes other than murder,|English
LJ009-0173|from eighteen thirty-two to eighteen forty-four not a single person had been executed in the metropolis except for this the gravest crime.|English
LJ009-0174|In eighteen thirty-seven the death penalty was practically limited to murder or attempts to murder,|English
LJ009-0175|and in eighteen forty-one this was accepted as the almost universally established rule.|English
LJ009-0176|Seven other crimes, however, were still capital by law, and so continued till the passing of the Criminal Consolidation Acts of eighteen sixty-one.|English
LJ009-0177|With the amelioration of the criminal code, other cruel concomitants of execution also disappeared.|English
LJ009-0178|In eighteen thirty-two the dissection of bodies cut down from the gallows, which had been decreed centuries previously, was abolished;|English
LJ009-0179|the most recent enactment in force was the ninth George the fourth cap. thirty-one, which directed the dissection of all bodies of executed murderers,|English
LJ009-0180|the idea being to intensify the dread of capital punishment. That such dread was not universal or deep-seated may be gathered from the fact|English
LJ009-0181|that authentic cases were known previous to the first cited act of criminals selling their own bodies to surgeons for dissection.|English
LJ009-0182|This dissection was carried out for Newgate prisoners in Surgeons' Hall, adjoining Newgate,|English
LJ009-0183|the site of the present Sessions House of the Old Bailey, and the operation was witnessed by students and a number of curious spectators.|English
LJ009-0184|Lord Ferrers' body was brought to Surgeons' Hall after execution in his own carriage and six;|English
LJ009-0185|after the post mortem had been carried out, the corpse was exposed to view in a first-floor room.|English
LJ009-0186|Pennant speaks of Surgeons' Hall as a handsome building, ornamented with Ionic pilasters, and with a double flight of steps to the first floor.|English
LJ009-0187|Beneath is a door for the admission of the bodies of murderers and other felons. There were other public dissecting rooms for criminals.|English
LJ009-0188|One was attached to Hicks' Hall, the Clerkenwell Sessions House, built out of monies provided by Sir Baptist Hicks, a wealthy alderman of the reign of James the first|English
LJ009-0189|Persons were still living in eighteen fifty-five who had witnessed dissections at Hicks' Hall, and|English
LJ009-0190|whom the horrid scene, with the additional effect of some noted criminals hanging on the walls, drove out again sick and faint,|English
LJ009-0191|as we have heard some relate, and with pale and terrified features, to get a breath of air.|English
LJ009-0192|The dissection of executed criminals was abolished soon after the discovery of the crime of burking,|English
LJ009-0193|with the idea that ignominy would no longer attach to an operation which ceased to be compulsory for the most degraded beings;|English
LJ009-0194|and that executors or persons having lawful possession of the bodies|English
LJ009-0195|of people who had died friendless, would voluntarily surrender them for the advancement of medical science.|English
LJ009-0196|Another brutal practice had nearly disappeared about the time of the abolition of dissection. This was the public exhibition of the body,|English
LJ009-0197|as was done in the case of Mrs. Phipoe, the murderess, who was executed in front of Newgate in seventeen ninety-eight,|English
LJ009-0198|and her body publicly exhibited in a place built for the purpose in the Old Bailey.|English
LJ009-0199|About this time I find that the bodies of two murderers, Clench and Mackay,|English
LJ009-0200|were publicly exposed in a stable in Little Bridge Street, near Apothecaries' Hall,|English
LJ009-0201|Surgeons' Hall being let to the lieutenancy of the county for the accommodation of the militia.|English
LJ009-0202|In eighteen eleven Williams, who murdered the Marrs in Ratcliffe Highway, having committed suicide in jail to escape hanging,|English
LJ009-0203|it was determined that a public exhibition should be made of the body through the neighborhood which had been the scene of the monster's crimes.|English
LJ009-0204|A long procession was formed, headed by constables, who cleared the way with their staves.|English
LJ009-0205|Then came the newly-formed horse patrol, with drawn cutlasses,|English
LJ009-0206|parish officers, peace officers, the high constable of the county of Middlesex on horseback, and then the body of Williams,|English
LJ009-0207|extended at full length on an inclined platform|English
LJ009-0208|erected on the cart, about four feet high at the head, and gradually sloping towards the horse, giving a full view of the body,|English
LJ009-0209|which was dressed in blue trousers and a blue-and-white striped waistcoat, but without a coat, as when found in the cell.|English
LJ009-0210|On the left side of the head the fatal mall,|English
LJ009-0211|and on the right the ripping chisel, with which the murders had been committed, were exposed to view.|English
LJ009-0212|The countenance of Williams was ghastly in the extreme, and the whole had an appearance too horrible for description.|English
LJ009-0213|The procession traversed Ratcliffe twice, halting for a quarter of an hour in front of the victims' dwelling,|English
LJ009-0214|"and was accompanied throughout by ""an immense concourse of persons, eager to get a sight of the murderer's remains."|English
LJ009-0215|All the shops in the neighborhood were shut, and the windows and tops of the houses were crowded with spectators.|English
LJ009-0216|Hanging in chains upon the gibbet which had served for the execution,|English
LJ009-0217|or on another specially erected on some commanding spot, had fallen into disuse by eighteen thirty-two.|English
LJ009-0218|But there was an attempt to revive it at that date, when the act for dispensing with the dissection of criminals was passed.|English
LJ009-0219|A clause was inserted to the effect that|English
LJ009-0220|the bodies of all prisoners convicted of murder should either be hung in chains, or buried under the gallows on which they had been executed,|English
LJ009-0221|according to the discretion of the court before whom the prisoners might be tried.|English
LJ009-0222|The revival of this barbarous practice caused much indignation in certain quarters,|English
LJ009-0223|but it was actually tried in two provincial towns, Leicester and Durham.|English
LJ009-0224|At the first-named the exhibition nearly created a tumult, and the body was taken down and buried,|English
LJ009-0225|but not before the greatest scandal had been caused by the unseemly proceedings of the crowd that flocked to see the sight. A sort of fair was held,|English
LJ009-0226|gaming-tables were set up, cards were played under the gibbet, to the disturbance of the public peace and the annoyance of all decent people.|English
LJ009-0227|At Jarrow Stake, where the Durham murderer's body was exposed, there were similar scenes, mingled with compassion for the culprit's family,|English
LJ009-0228|and a subscription was set on foot for them then and there at the foot of the gibbet.|English
LJ009-0229|Later on, after dark, some friends of the deceased stole the body and buried it in the sand, and this was the end of hanging in chains.|English
LJ009-0230|After this a law was passed which prescribed that the bodies of all executed murderers should be buried within the walls of the jail.|English
LJ009-0231|Although these objectionable practices had disappeared,|English
LJ009-0232|there were still many shocking incidents at executions, owing to the bungling and unskilful way in which the operation was performed.|English
LJ009-0233|The rope still broke sometimes, although it was not often that the horrid scene seen at Jersey at the beginning of the century was repeated.|English
LJ009-0234|There the hangman added his weight to that of the suspended culprit,|English
LJ009-0235|and having first pulled him sideways, then got upon his shoulders, so that the rope broke.|English
LJ009-0236|To the great surprise of all who witnessed this dreadful scene,|English
LJ009-0237|the poor criminal rose straight upon his feet, with the hangman on his shoulders, and immediately loosened the rope with his fingers.|English
LJ009-0238|After this the sheriffs sent for another rope, but the spectators interfered, and the man was carried back to jail.|English
LJ009-0239|The whole case was referred to the king, and the poor wretch, whose crime had been a military one, was eventually pardoned.|English
LJ009-0240|A somewhat similar event happened at Chester not long afterwards; the ropes by which two offenders were turned off broke a few inches from their necks.|English
LJ009-0241|They were taken back to jail, and were again brought out in the afternoon, by which time fresh and stronger ropes had been procured,|English
LJ009-0242|and the sentence was properly and completely carried out.|English
LJ009-0243|Other cases might be quoted,|English
LJ009-0244|especially that of William Snow, alias Sketch, who slipped from the gallows at Exeter and fell to the ground.|English
LJ009-0245|He soon rose to his feet, and hearing the sorrowful exclamations of the populace, coolly said,|English
LJ009-0246|Good people, do not be hurried; I am not, I can wait.|English
LJ009-0247|Similar cases were not wanting as regards the executions before Newgate. Others were not less horrible, although there was no failure of apparatus.|English
LJ009-0248|Sometimes the condemned man made a hard fight for life.|English
LJ009-0249|When Charles White was executed in eighteen twenty-three for arson, he arranged a handkerchief|English
LJ009-0250|in such a way that the executioner found a difficulty in pinioning his hands.|English
LJ009-0251|White managed to keep his wrists asunder, and continued to struggle with the officials for some time. Eventually he was pinioned with a cord in the usual manner.|English
LJ009-0252|On the scaffold he made a violent attempt to loosen his bonds, and succeeded in getting his hands free.|English
LJ009-0253|Then with a strong effort he pushed off the white cap, and tried to liberate his neck from the halter, which by this time had been adjusted.|English
LJ009-0254|The hangman summoned assistance, and with help tied the cap over White's face with a handkerchief.|English
LJ009-0255|The miserable wretch during the whole of this time was struggling with the most determined violence, to the great horror of the spectators.|English
LJ009-0256|Still he resisted.|English
LJ009-0257|and having got from the falling drop to the firm part of the platform, he nearly succeeded in tearing the handkerchief from his eyes.|English
LJ009-0258|However, the ceremony went forward, and when the signal was given the drop sank.|English
LJ009-0259|The wretched man did not fall with it, but jumped on to the platform, and seizing the rope with his hands, tried to avoid strangulation.|English
LJ009-0260|The spectacle was horrible;|English
LJ009-0261|the convict was half on the platform, half hanging, and the convulsions of his body were appalling.|English
LJ009-0262|The crowd vociferously yelled their disapproval, and at length|English
LJ009-0263|the executioner forced the struggling criminal from the platform, so that the rope sustained his whole weight.|English
LJ009-0264|His face was visible to the whole crowd, and was fearful to behold.|English
LJ009-0265|Even now his sufferings were not at an end,|English
LJ009-0266|and his death was not compassed until the executioner terminated his sufferings by hanging on to his legs.|English
LJ009-0267|When Luigi Buranelli was executed in eighteen fifty-five,|English
LJ009-0268|through the improper adjustment of the rope his sufferings were prolonged for five minutes;|English
LJ009-0269|his chest heaved, and it was evident that his struggle was a fearful one.|English
LJ009-0270|A worse case still was that of William Bousfield, who, when awaiting execution for murder, about the same date,|English
LJ009-0271|had attempted to throw himself upon the fire in his condemned cell.|English
LJ009-0272|He was in consequence so weak when brought out for execution, that he had to be carried by four men,|English
LJ009-0273|two supporting his body and two his legs.|English
LJ009-0274|His wretched, abject condition, seated in a chair under the drop, was such as almost to unnerve the executioner Calcraft,|English
LJ009-0275|who bad been further upset by a letter threatening to shoot him when he appeared to perform his task.|English
LJ009-0276|Calcraft, the moment he had adjusted the cap and rope, ran down the steps, drew the bolt, and disappeared.|English
LJ009-0277|For a second or two the body hung motionless, then, with a strength that astonished the attendant officials,|English
LJ009-0278|Bousfield slowly drew himself up, and rested with his feet on the right side of the drop.|English
LJ009-0279|One of the turnkeys rushed forward and pushed him off.|English
LJ009-0280|Again the wretched creature succeeded in obtaining foothold, but this time on the left side of the drop.|English
LJ009-0281|Calcraft was forced to return, and he once more pushed Bousfield off,|English
LJ009-0282|who for the fourth time regained his foothold. Again he was repelled,|English
LJ009-0283|this time Calcraft adding his weight to the body, and the strangulation was completed.|English
LJ009-0284|It was stated in evidence before the Commission on Capital Punishment in eighteen sixty-four,|English
LJ009-0285|that Calcraft's method of hanging was very rough, much the same as if he had been hanging a dog.|English
LJ009-0286|"There has never been much science in the system of carrying out the extreme penalty in this country; the ""finisher of the law"""|English
LJ009-0287|has come more by chance than fitness or special education to exercise his loathsome office.|English
LJ009-0288|Calcraft, of whom mention has just been made, was by trade a lady's shoemaker,|English
LJ009-0289|and before he took to hanging he was employed as a watchman at Reid's brewery in Liquorpond Street.|English
LJ009-0290|He was at first engaged as assistant to the executioner Tom Cheshire, but in due course rose to be chief.|English
LJ009-0291|He was always known as a mild-mannered man of simple tastes, much given to angling in the New River, and a devoted rabbit fancier.|English
LJ009-0292|"He was well known in the neighborhood where he resided, and the street gamins cried ""Jack Ketch"" as he went along the street."|English
LJ009-0293|While Calcraft was in office other aspirants to fame appeared in the field.|English
LJ009-0294|One was Askern,|English
LJ009-0295|who had been a convicted prisoner at York, but who consented to act as hangman when Calcraft was engaged, and no other functionary could be obtained.|English
LJ009-0296|It was not always easy to hire a hangman.|English
LJ009-0297|There is still extant a curious petition presented to the Treasury by Ralph Griffith, Esq., high sheriff of Flintshire,|English
LJ009-0298|which sets forth that the petitioner had been at great expense by sending clerks and agents to Liverpool and Shrewsbury to hire an executioner.|English
LJ009-0299|The man to be hanged belonged to Wales, and no Welshman would do the job.|English
LJ009-0300|Traveling expenses of these agents cost fifteen pounds, and another ten pounds were spent in the hire of a Shropshire man,|English
LJ009-0301|who deserted, and was pursued, but without success.|English
LJ009-0302|Another man was hired, himself a convict, whose fees for self and wife were twelve guineas.|English
LJ009-0303|Then came the cost of the gallows,|English
LJ009-0304|four pounds, twelve shillings; and finally the funeral, cart, coffin, and other petty expenses, amounting to seven pounds ten|English
LJ010-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section thirteen: Newgate notorieties, part one.|English
LJ010-0002|In chapter two of the present volume I brought down the record of crime to the second decade of the present century.|English
LJ010-0003|I propose now to continue the subject, and to devote a couple of chapters to criminal occurrences of a more recent date,|English
LJ010-0004|only premising that as accounts become more voluminous I shall be compelled to deal with fewer cases,|English
LJ010-0005|taking in preference those which are typical and invested with peculiar interest. It is somewhat remarkable that a marked change soon comes over the Calendar.|English
LJ010-0006|Certain crimes, those against the person especially, diminished gradually. They became less easy or remunerative.|English
LJ010-0007|Police protection was better and more effective;|English
LJ010-0008|the streets of London were well lighted, the suburbs were more populous and regularly patrolled.|English
LJ010-0009|People, too, were getting into the habit of carrying but little cash about them, and no valuables but their watches or personal jewelery.|English
LJ010-0010|Street robberies offered fewer inducements to depredators, and evil-doers were compelled to adopt other methods of preying upon their fellows.|English
LJ010-0011|This led to a rapid and marked increase in all kinds of fraud;|English
LJ010-0012|and prominent in the criminal annals of Newgate in these later years will be found numerous remarkable instances of this class of offense --|English
LJ010-0013|forgeries committed systematically, and for long periods, as in the case of Fauntleroy,|English
LJ010-0014|to cover enormous defalcations; the fabrication of deeds, wills, and false securities|English
LJ010-0015|for the purpose of misappropriating funds or feloniously obtaining cash;|English
LJ010-0016|thefts of bullion, bank-notes, specie, and gold-dust, planned with consummate ingenuity,|English
LJ010-0017|eluding the keenest vigilance, and carried out with reckless daring;|English
LJ010-0018|jewel-boxes cleverly stolen under the very noses of owners or care-takers.|English
LJ010-0019|As time passed,|English
LJ010-0020|the extraordinary extension of all commercial operations led to many entirely novel and often gigantic financial frauds.|English
LJ010-0021|The credulity of investors, the unscrupulous dishonesty of bankers,|English
LJ010-0022|the slackness of supervision over wholly irresponsible agents, produced many terrible monetary catastrophes,|English
LJ010-0023|and lodged men like Cole, Robson, and Redpath in Newgate.|English
LJ010-0024|While the varying conditions of social life thus brought about many changes in the character of offenses against property,|English
LJ010-0025|those against the person became more and more limited to the most heinous, or those which menaced or destroyed life.|English
LJ010-0026|There was no increase in murder or manslaughter; the number of such crimes remained pretty constant proportionately to population.|English
LJ010-0027|Nor did the methods by which they were perpetrated greatly vary from those in times past.|English
LJ010-0028|The causes also continued much the same. Passion, revenge, cupidity, sudden ebullitions of homicidal rage,|English
LJ010-0029|the cold-blooded, calculating atrocity born of self-interest, were still the irresistible incentives to kill.|English
LJ010-0030|The brutal ferocity of the wild beast once aroused, the same means, the same weapons were employed to do the dreadful deed,|English
LJ010-0031|the same and happily often futile precautions taken to conceal the crime.|English
LJ010-0032|Pegsworth, and Greenacre, and Daniel Good merely reproduced types that had gone before, and that have since reappeared.|English
LJ010-0033|Esther Hibner was as inhuman in her ill-usage of the parish apprentice she killed as Martha Brownrigg had been.|English
LJ010-0034|Thurtell and Hunt followed in the footsteps of Billings, Wood, and Catherine Hayes.|English
LJ010-0035|Courvoisier might have lived a century earlier.|English
LJ010-0036|Hocker was found upon the scene of his crime, irresistibly attracted thither, as was Theodore Gardelle.|English
LJ010-0037|Now and again there seemed to be a recurrence of a murder epidemic,|English
LJ010-0038|as there had been before; as in the year eighteen forty-nine, a year memorable for the Rush murders at Norwich,|English
LJ010-0039|the Gleeson Wilson murder at Liverpool, that of the Mannings in London, and of many more.|English
LJ010-0040|"Men like Mobbs, the miscreant known as ""General Haynau"" on account of his blood-thirstiness, still murdered their wives;"|English
LJ010-0041|or like Cannon the chimney-sweeper, who savagely killed the policeman.|English
LJ010-0042|A not altogether new crime, however, akin to murder,|English
LJ010-0043|although happily never passing beyond dastardly attempts, cropped up in these times, and was often frequently repeated within a short interval.|English
LJ010-0044|The present Queen very soon after her accession|English
LJ010-0045|became the victim of the most cowardly and unmanly outrages, and the attempted murder of the sovereign by Oxford in eighteen forty|English
LJ010-0046|was followed in the very next year by those of Francis and of Bean in two consecutive months,|English
LJ010-0047|while in eighteen fifty Her Majesty was the victim of another outrage at the hands of one Pate.|English
LJ010-0048|These crimes had their origin too often in the disordered brains of lunatics at large, like Captain Goode.|English
LJ010-0049|Their perpetrators were charged with high treason, but met with merciful clemency as irresponsible beings.|English
LJ010-0050|But at various dates treason more distinct and tangible came to the front: attempts to levy war against the State.|English
LJ010-0051|The well-known Cato Street conspiracy,|English
LJ010-0052|which grew out of disturbed social conditions after the last French war, amidst general distress,|English
LJ010-0053|and when the people were beginning to agitate for a larger share of political power, was among the earliest, and to some extent the most desperate, of these.|English
LJ010-0054|Its ringleaders, Thistlewood and the rest, were after capture honored by committal as State prisoners to the Tower,|English
LJ010-0055|but they came one and all to Newgate for trial at the Old Bailey, and remained there after conviction till they were hanged.|English
LJ010-0056|Later on, the Chartists agitated persistently for the concession embraced in the so-called People's Charter, many of which|English
LJ010-0057|are by this time actually, and by more legitimate efforts, engrafted upon our Constitution.|English
LJ010-0058|But the Chartists sought their ends by riot and rebellion, and gained only imprisonment for their pains.|English
LJ010-0059|Some five hundred in all were arrested, but as only three of these were lodged in Newgate, I shall not recur to them in my narrative.|English
LJ010-0060|The Cato Street conspiracy would have been simply ridiculous but for the recklessness of the desperadoes who planned it.|English
LJ010-0061|That some thirty or more needy men should hope to revolutionize England is a sufficient proof of the absurdity of their attempt.|English
LJ010-0062|But they proceeded in all seriousness, and would have shrunk from no outrage or atrocity in furtherance of their foolhardy enterprise.|English
LJ010-0063|The massacre of the whole of the Cabinet Ministers at one stroke was to be followed by an attack|English
LJ010-0064|"upon ""the old man and the old woman,"" as they styled the Mansion House and the Bank of England."|English
LJ010-0065|"At the former the ""Provisional Government"" was to be established,"|English
LJ010-0066|which under Thistlewood as dictator was to rule the nation, by first handing over its capital to fire and pillage.|English
LJ010-0067|This Thistlewood had seen many vicissitudes throughout his strange, adventurous career. The son of a respectable Lincolnshire farmer,|English
LJ010-0068|he became a militia officer, and married a woman with ten thousand pounds, in which, however, she had only a life interest.|English
LJ010-0069|She died early, and Thistlewood, left to his own resources,|English
LJ010-0070|followed the profession of arms, first in the British service, and then in that of the French revolutionary Government.|English
LJ010-0071|It was during this period that he was said to have imbibed his revolutionary ideas.|English
LJ010-0072|Returning to England,|English
LJ010-0073|he found himself rich in a small landed property, which he presently sold to a man who became bankrupt before he had paid over the purchase money.|English
LJ010-0074|After this he tried farming, but failed.|English
LJ010-0075|He married again and came to London, where he soon became notorious as a reckless gambler and a politician holding the most extreme views.|English
LJ010-0076|In this way he formed the acquaintance of Watson and others, with whom he was arraigned for treasonable practices, and imprisoned.|English
LJ010-0077|On his release he sent a challenge to Lord Sidmouth, the Home Secretary, and was again arrested and imprisoned.|English
LJ010-0078|On his second release, goaded by his fancied wrongs, he began to plot a dark and dreadful revenge,|English
LJ010-0079|and thus the conspiracy in which he was the prime mover took shape, and came to a head.|English
LJ010-0080|The Government obtained early and full information of the nefarious scheme.|English
LJ010-0081|One of the conspirators, by name Edwards,|English
LJ010-0082|made a voluntary confession to Sir Herbert Taylor one morning at Windsor; after which Thistlewood and his accomplices were closely watched,|English
LJ010-0083|and measures taken to arrest them when their plans were so far developed that no doubt could remain as to their guilt.|English
LJ010-0084|The day appointed for the murder and rising actually arrived before the authorities interfered.|English
LJ010-0085|It was the day on which Lord Harrowby was to entertain his colleagues at dinner in Grosvenor Square.|English
LJ010-0086|The occasion was considered excellent by the conspirators for disposal of the whole Cabinet at one blow,|English
LJ010-0087|and it was arranged that one of their number should knock at Lord Harrowby's door on the pretense of leaving a parcel,|English
LJ010-0088|and that when it was opened the whole band should rush in.|English
LJ010-0089|While a few secured the servants, the rest were to fall upon Lord Harrowby and his guests.|English
LJ010-0090|Hand-grenades were to be thrown into the dining-room, and during the noise and confusion the assassination of the ministers was to be completed,|English
LJ010-0091|the heads of Lord Castlereagh and Lord Sidmouth being carried away in a bag.|English
LJ010-0092|Lord Harrowby's dinner-party was postponed, but the conspirators knew nothing of it,|English
LJ010-0093|and those who watched his house were further encouraged in their mistake by the arrival of many carriages,|English
LJ010-0094|bound, as it happened, to the Archbishop of York's.|English
LJ010-0095|Meanwhile the main body remained at their headquarters, a ruined stable in Cato Street,|English
LJ010-0096|Edgeware Road, completing their dispositions for assuming supreme power after the blow had been struck.|English
LJ010-0097|Here they were surprised by the police, headed by a magistrate, and supported by a strong detachment of Her Majesty's Guards.|English
LJ010-0098|The police were the first to arrive on the spot, the Guards having entered the street at the wrong end.|English
LJ010-0099|The conspirators were in a loft, approached by a ladder and a trap-door, access through which could only be obtained one by one.|English
LJ010-0100|The first constable who entered Thistlewood ran through the body with a sword, but others quickly followed,|English
LJ010-0101|the lights were extinguished, and a desperate conflict ensued.|English
LJ010-0102|The Guards, headed by Lord Adolphus Fitz Clarence, now reinforced the police, and the conspirators gave way.|English
LJ010-0103|Nine of the latter were captured, with all the war material, cutlasses, pistols, hand-grenades, and ammunition.|English
LJ010-0104|Thistlewood and fourteen more succeeded for the moment in making their escape, but most of them were subsequently taken.|English
LJ010-0105|Thistlewood was discovered next morning in a mean house in White Street, Moorfields.|English
LJ010-0106|He was in bed with his breeches on (in the pockets of which were found a number of cartridges), the black belt he had worn at Cato Street,|English
LJ010-0107|and a military sash.|English
LJ010-0108|The trial of the conspirators came on some six weeks later, at the Old Bailey.|English
LJ010-0109|Thistlewood made a long and rambling defense, the chief features of which were abuse of Lord Sidmouth, and the vilification of the informer Edwards.|English
LJ010-0110|Several of the other prisoners took the same line as regards Edwards,|English
LJ010-0111|and there seems to have been good reason for supposing that he was a greater villain than any of those arraigned.|English
LJ010-0112|"He had been in a state of abject misery, and when he first joined ""the reformers,"" as the Cato Street conspirators called themselves,"|English
LJ010-0113|he had neither a bed to lie upon nor a coat to his back.|English
LJ010-0114|His sudden access to means unlimited was no doubt due to the profitable role he soon adopted of Government informer and spy,|English
LJ010-0115|and it is pretty certain that for some time he served both sides;|English
LJ010-0116|on the one inveigling silly enthusiasts to join in the plot, and denouncing them on the other.|English
LJ010-0117|The employment of Edwards, and the manner in which the conspirators were allowed to commit themselves further and further before the law was set in motion against them,|English
LJ010-0118|were not altogether creditable to the Government.|English
LJ010-0119|It was asserted, not without foundation, at these trials, that Edwards repeatedly incited the associates he was betraying|English
LJ010-0120|to commit outrage, to set fire to houses, throw hand-grenades into the carriages of ministers;|English
LJ010-0121|"that he was, to use Thistlewood's words, ""a contriver, instigator, and entrapper."""|English
LJ010-0122|The Government were probably not proud of their agent, for Edwards, after the conviction had been assured, went abroad to enjoy, it was said,|English
LJ010-0123|an ample pension, so long as he did not return to England.|English
LJ010-0124|Five of the conspirators, Thistlewood, Ings, Brunt, Davidson, and Tidd, were sentenced to death,|English
LJ010-0125|and suffered in the usual way in front of Newgate, with the additional penalty of decapitation, as traitors, after they had been hanged.|English
LJ010-0126|A crowd as great as any known collected in the Old Bailey to see the ceremony, about which there were some peculiar features worth recording.|English
LJ010-0127|The reckless demeanor of all the convicts except Davidson was most marked. Thistlewood and Ings sucked oranges on the scaffold;|English
LJ010-0128|they with Brunt and Tidd scorned the ordinary's ministrations,|English
LJ010-0129|but Ings said he hoped God would be more merciful to him than men had been.|English
LJ010-0130|Ings was especially defiant. He sought to cheer Davidson, who seemed affected, crying out,|English
LJ010-0131|Come, old cock-of-wax, it will soon be over.|English
LJ010-0132|As the executioner fastened the noose, he nodded to a friend he saw in the crowd;|English
LJ010-0133|and catching sight of the coffins ranged around the gallows, he smiled at the show with contemptuous indifference.|English
LJ010-0134|He roared out snatches of a song about Death or Liberty, and just before he was turned off,|English
LJ010-0135|yelled out three cheers to the populace whom he faced.|English
LJ010-0136|"He told the executioner to ""do it tidy,"" to pull it tight, and was in a state of hysterical exaltation up to the very last."|English
LJ010-0137|Davidson, who was the only one who seemed to realize his awful situation, listened patiently and with thankfulness to the chaplain,|English
LJ010-0138|and died in a manner strongly contrasting with that of his fellows.|English
LJ010-0139|After the five bodies had hung for half-an-hour, a man in a mask came forward to complete the sentence.|English
LJ010-0140|Contemporary reports state that from the skillful manner in which he performed the decapitation,|English
LJ010-0141|he was generally supposed to be a surgeon.|English
LJ010-0142|Be this as it may, the weapon used was only an ordinary axe, which rather indicates that force, not skill, was employed.|English
LJ010-0143|This axe is still in existence, and is preserved at Newgate with various other unpleasant curiosities,|English
LJ010-0144|but is only an ordinary commonplace tool.|English
LJ010-0145|These were the last executions for high treason, but not the last prisoners by many who passed through Newgate charged with sedition.|English
LJ010-0146|Attacks upon the sovereign, as I have said, became more common after the accession of the young Queen Victoria in eighteen thirty-eight.|English
LJ010-0147|It was a form of high treason not unknown in earlier reigns. In seventeen eighty-six a mad woman, Margaret Nicholson,|English
LJ010-0148|tried to stab George the third as he was alighting from his carriage at the gate of St. James's Palace.|English
LJ010-0149|She was seized before she could do any mischief,|English
LJ010-0150|and eventually lodged in Bethlehem Hospital, where she died after forty years' detention, at the advanced age of one hundred.|English
LJ010-0151|Again, a soldier, by name Hatfield, who had been wounded in the head, and discharged from the army for unsoundness of mind,|English
LJ010-0152|fired a pistol at George the third from the pit of Drury Lane theatre in eighteen hundred.|English
LJ010-0153|William the fourth was also the victim of a murderous outrage on Ascot race-course in eighteen thirty-two,|English
LJ010-0154|"when John Collins, ""a person in the garb of a sailor, of wretched appearance, and having a wooden leg,"""|English
LJ010-0155|threw a stone at the king, which hit him on the forehead, but did no serious injury.|English
LJ010-0156|Collins, when charged, pleaded that he had lost his leg in action, that he had petitioned without success for a pension,|English
LJ010-0157|and that, as he was starving, he had resolved on this desperate deed,|English
LJ010-0158|feeling, as he said, that he might as well be shot or hanged as remain in such a state.|English
LJ010-0159|He was eventually sentenced to death, but the plea of lunacy was allowed, and he was confined for life.|English
LJ010-0160|None of the foregoing attempts were, however, so dastardly or determined as that made by Oxford upon our present gracious Queen|English
LJ010-0161|two years after she ascended the throne.|English
LJ010-0162|The cowardly crime was probably encouraged by the fearless and confiding manner in which the Queen,|English
LJ010-0163|secure as it seemed in the affections of her loyal people, freely appeared in public.|English
LJ010-0164|Oxford, who was only nineteen at the time his offense was committed, had been born at Birmingham,|English
LJ010-0165|but he came as a lad to London, and took service as a pot-boy to a publican.|English
LJ010-0166|From this he was promoted to barman, and as such had charge of the business in various public-houses.|English
LJ010-0167|He left his last situation in April eighteen forty, and established himself in lodgings in Lambeth,|English
LJ010-0168|after which he devoted himself to pistol practice in shooting-galleries, sometimes in Leicester Square,|English
LJ010-0169|sometimes in the Strand, or the West End.|English
LJ010-0170|His acquaintances often asked his object in this, but he kept his own counsel till the tenth June.|English
LJ010-0171|On that day Oxford was on the watch at Buckingham Palace.|English
LJ010-0172|He saw Prince Albert return there from a visit to Woolwich, and then passed on to Constitution Hill,|English
LJ010-0173|where he waited till four p.m., the time at which the Queen and Prince Consort usually took an afternoon drive.|English
LJ010-0174|About six p.m. the royal carriage, a low open vehicle drawn by four horses, ridden by postilions, left the palace.|English
LJ010-0175|Oxford, who had been pacing backwards and forwards with his hands under the lapels of his coat, saw the carriage approach.|English
LJ010-0176|He was on the right or north side of the road. Prince Albert occupied the same side of the carriage, the Queen the left.|English
LJ010-0177|As the carriage came up to him Oxford turned, put his hand into his breast, drew a pistol, and fired at the Queen.|English
LJ010-0178|The shot missed, and as the carriage passed on, Oxford drew a second pistol and fired again.|English
LJ010-0179|The Queen saw this second movement, and stooped to avoid the shot;|English
LJ010-0180|the Prince too rose to shield her with his person. Again, providentially, the bullet went wide of the mark,|English
LJ010-0181|and the royal party drove back to Clarence House, the Queen being anxious to give the first news of the outrage and of her safety to her mother,|English
LJ010-0182|the Duchess of Kent.|English
LJ010-0183|Meanwhile the pistol-shots had attracted the attention of the bystanders, of whom there was a fair collection, as usual, waiting to see the Queen pass.|English
LJ010-0184|Oxford was seized by a person named Lowe, who was at first mistaken for the assailant.|English
LJ010-0185|"But Oxford at once assumed the responsibility for his crime, saying, ""It was I. I did it. I'll give myself up."|English
LJ010-0186|There is no occasion to use violence. I will go with you.|English
LJ010-0187|He was taken into custody, and removed first to a police cell, thence committed to Newgate, after he had been examined before the Privy Council.|English
LJ010-0188|Oxford expressed little anxiety or concern.|English
LJ010-0189|He asked more than once whether the Queen was hurt, and acknowledged that the pistols were loaded with ball.|English
LJ010-0190|A craze for notoriety, to be achieved at any cost, was the one absorbing idea in young Oxford's disordered brain.|English
LJ010-0191|After his arrest he thought only of the excitement his attempt had raised, nothing of its atrocity,|English
LJ010-0192|or of the fatal consequences which might have ensued.|English
LJ010-0193|When brought to trial he hardly realized his position,|English
LJ010-0194|but gazed with complacency around the crowded court, and eagerly inquired what persons of distinction were present.|English
LJ010-0195|He smiled continually, and when the indictment was read, burst into loud and discordant fits of laughter.|English
LJ010-0196|These antics may have been assumed to bear out the plea of insanity set up in his defense,|English
LJ010-0197|but that there was madness in his family, and that he himself was of unsound mind, could not be well denied.|English
LJ010-0198|His father, it was proved in evidence, had been at times quite mad; and Oxford's mental state might be inferred from his own proceedings.|English
LJ010-0199|Among his papers was found a curious document, purporting to be the rules of an association called|English
LJ010-0200|Young England, which Oxford had evolved out of his own inflated self-conceit, and which had never any real corporeal existence.|English
LJ010-0201|Young England was a secret society, with no aim or object.|English
LJ010-0202|Its sworn members, known only to Oxford, and all of them mere shadows,|English
LJ010-0203|were bound to provide themselves with sword, rifle, dagger, and a pair of pistols;|English
LJ010-0204|to wear a black crape mask, to obey punctually the orders of their commander-in-chief,|English
LJ010-0205|and to assume any disguise, if required to go into the country on the business of the association.|English
LJ010-0206|"The officers of the society were to be known only by ""factitious names."""|English
LJ010-0207|Thus, among the presidents were those of Gowrie, Justinian, Aloman, Colsman, Kenneth, and Godfrey;|English
LJ010-0208|Hannibal and Ethelred were on the council; Anthony, Augustus, and Frederic were among the generals;|English
LJ010-0209|Louis and Amadeus among the captains; and Hercules, Neptune, and Mars among the lieutenants of the association.|English
LJ010-0210|The various grades were distinguished by cockades and bows of different colors.|English
LJ010-0211|The society was supposed to meet regularly, and its proceedings, together with the speeches made, were duly recorded.|English
LJ010-0212|With Oxford's other papers were found letters from the secretary, written as it seemed by Oxford to himself, after the manner of Mr. Toots,|English
LJ010-0213|all of which declared their approval of the commander-in-chief.|English
LJ010-0214|"One expressed pleasure that Oxford improved so much in speaking, and declared that his (Oxford's) speech the last time ""was beautiful."""|English
LJ010-0215|"This letter went on to say that a new member had been introduced by Lt. Mars, ""a fine, tall, gentlemanly young man,"|English
LJ010-0216|and it is said that he is a military officer, but his name has not yet transpired.|English
LJ010-0217|Soon after he was introduced we were alarmed by a violent knocking at the door;|English
LJ010-0218|in an instant our faces were covered, we cocked our pistols, and with drawn swords stood waiting to receive the enemy.|English
LJ010-0219|While one stood over the fire with the papers, another stood with lighted torch to fire the house.|English
LJ010-0220|We then sent the old woman to open the door, and it proved to be some little boys who had knocked and ran away.|English
LJ010-0221|"Another letter directed Oxford to attend an extraordinary meeting of ""Young England"""|English
LJ010-0222|in consequence of having received some information of an important nature from Hanover.|English
LJ010-0223|You must attend; and if your master will not give you leave, you must come in defiance of him.|English
LJ010-0224|No serious importance could be attached to these, the manifest inventions of a disordered intellect.|English
LJ010-0225|The whole of the evidence pointed so strongly towards insanity, that the jury brought in a verdict of acquittal on that ground,|English
LJ010-0226|and Oxford was ordered to be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure.|English
LJ010-0227|He went from Newgate first to Bethlehem, from which he was removed to Broadmoor on the opening of the great criminal lunatic asylum at that place.|English
LJ010-0228|He was released from Broadmoor in eighteen seventy-eight, and went abroad.|English
LJ010-0229|Within a couple of years a second attempt to assassinate the Queen was perpetrated in nearly the same spot, by a man named John Francis,|English
LJ010-0230|who was arrested in the very act, just as he had fired one shot.|English
LJ010-0231|His motives for thus imitating the dastardly crime of Oxford are shrouded in obscurity.|English
LJ010-0232|He could not plead insanity like his predecessor, and no attempt was made at his trial to prove him of unsound mind.|English
LJ010-0233|Here again probably it was partly the love of notoriety which was the incentive,|English
LJ010-0234|backed possibly with the hope that, as in a much more recent case,|English
LJ010-0235|he would be in some way provided for, he having been for some time previously in abject circumstances.|English
LJ010-0236|The deed was long premeditated, and would have been executed a day earlier had not his courage failed him at the last moment.|English
LJ010-0237|A youth named Pearson had seen him present a pistol at the Queen's carriage,|English
LJ010-0238|"but draw it back again, exclaiming presently, ""I wish I had done it."""|English
LJ010-0239|Pearson weakly allowed Francis to go off without securing his apprehension, but later he gave full information.|English
LJ010-0240|The Queen was apprised of the danger, and begged not to go abroad;|English
LJ010-0241|but she declared she would not remain a prisoner in her own palace, and next day drove out as usual in an open barouche.|English
LJ010-0242|Nothing happened till Her Majesty returned to Buckingham Palace about six p.m., when, on descending Constitution Hill,|English
LJ010-0243|with an equerry riding close on each side of her carriage, a man who had been leaning against the palace garden wall suddenly advanced,|English
LJ010-0244|leveled a pistol at the Queen, and fired. He was so close to the carriage that the smoke of his pistol enveloped the face of Colonel Wylde,|English
LJ010-0245|one of the equerries. The Queen was untouched, and at first, it is said, hardly realized the danger she had escaped.|English
LJ010-0246|Francis had already been seized by a policeman named Trounce, who saw his movement with the pistol, but too late to prevent its discharge.|English
LJ010-0247|The prisoner was conveyed without delay to the Home Office, and there examined by the Privy Council, which had been hastily summoned for the purpose.|English
LJ010-0248|On searching him the pistol was found in his pocket, the barrel still warm; also some loose powder and a bullet.|English
LJ010-0249|There was some doubt as to whether the pistol when fired was actually loaded with ball, but the jury brought in a verdict of guilty|English
LJ010-0250|of the criminal intent to kill.|English
LJ010-0251|Francis was sentenced to be hanged, decapitated, and quartered,|English
LJ010-0252|the old traitor's doom, but was spared, and subsequently transported for life.|English
LJ010-0253|The enthusiasm of the people at the Queen's escape was uproarious, and her drive next day was one long triumphal progress.|English
LJ010-0254|At the Italian Opera in the evening the audience, on the Queen's appearance, greeted her with loud cheers, and called for the national anthem.|English
LJ010-0255|This was in May eighteen forty-two.|English
LJ010-0256|Undeterred by the well-merited punishment which had overtaken Francis,|English
LJ010-0257|a third miscreant made a similar but far less serious attempt in the month of July following.|English
LJ010-0258|As the Queen was driving from Buckingham Palace to the Chapel Royal,|English
LJ010-0259|a deformed lad among the crowd was seen to present a pistol at Her Majesty's carriage,|English
LJ010-0260|in the Mall, about half-way between Buckingham and St. James's Palaces.|English
LJ010-0261|Only one person saw the movement, a lad named Dasset, who at once collared the cripple, and taking him up to two policemen,|English
LJ010-0262|charged him with the offense.|English
LJ010-0263|The policemen treated the matter as a hoax, and allowed the culprit to make off.|English
LJ010-0264|Later on, however, Dasset was himself seized and interrogated,|English
LJ010-0265|and on his information handbills were circulated, giving the exact description of the deformed youth, who had a hump-back,|English
LJ010-0266|and a long, sickly, pale face, with light hair;|English
LJ010-0267|his nose was marked with a scar or black patch, and he was altogether of a dirty appearance.|English
LJ010-0268|It happened that a lad named Bean had absconded from his father's home some weeks before,|English
LJ010-0269|whose description, as given by his father to the police,|English
LJ010-0270|"exactly tallied with that of the deformed person ""wanted"" for the assault on the Queen."|English
LJ010-0271|A visit to the father's residence was followed by the arrest of the son, who had by this time returned.|English
LJ010-0272|This son, John William Bean, was fully identified by Dasset, and presently examined by the Privy Council.|English
LJ010-0273|He was eventually charged with a misdemeanor, the capital charge having been abandoned, and committed for trial.|English
LJ010-0274|Much the same motives of seeking notoriety seem to have impelled Bean, who was perfectly sane, to his rash act;|English
LJ010-0275|but it was proved that the pistol was not loaded with ball,|English
LJ010-0276|"and he was only convicted of an attempt ""to harass, vex, and grieve the sovereign."|English
LJ010-0277|Lord Abinger sentenced him to eighteen months' imprisonment in Newgate,|English
LJ010-0278|but the place of durance was changed, to meet the existing law, to Millbank Penitentiary.|English
LJ010-0279|I shall mention briefly one more case, in which, however, there was no murderous intent, before I pass on to other crimes.|English
LJ010-0280|On June eighteen fifty the Queen was once more subjected to cowardly outrage, the offender being a Mr. Pate, a gentleman by birth,|English
LJ010-0281|who had borne the Queen's commission, first as cornet, and then lieutenant, in the tenth Hussars.|English
LJ010-0282|Pate was said to be an eccentric person, given to strange acts and antics, such as mixing whiskey and camphor with his morning bath-water,|English
LJ010-0283|and walking for choice through prickly gorse bushes.|English
LJ010-0284|He always kept the blinds down at his chambers in Jermyn Street; and as the St. James's clock chimed quarter-past three,|English
LJ010-0285|invariably went out in a cab, for which he always paid the same fare,|English
LJ010-0286|nine shillings, all in shillings, and no other coin.|English
LJ010-0287|"But this was not sufficient to constitute lunacy, nor was his plea of ""momentary uncontrollable impulse"""|English
LJ010-0288|deemed valid as any palliation of his offense.|English
LJ010-0289|That offense was a brutal assault upon Her Majesty, whom he struck in the face with a small stick just as she was leaving Cambridge House.|English
LJ010-0290|The blow crushed the bonnet and bruised the forehead of the Queen, who was happily not otherwise injured.|English
LJ010-0291|Pate was found guilty, and sentenced to seven years' transportation, the judge, Baron Alderson, abstaining from inflicting the penalty of whipping,|English
LJ010-0292|which was authorized by a recent act, on account of Mr. Pate's family and position in life.|English
LJ010-0293|I have already remarked that as violence was more and more eliminated from crimes against the person,|English
LJ010-0294|frauds indicating great boldness, extensive design, and ingenuity became more prevalent.|English
LJ010-0295|The increase of bank forgeries, and its cause, I referred to in a previous chapter.|English
LJ010-0296|At one session of the Old Bailey, in eighteen twenty-one, no less than thirty-five true bills were found for passing forged notes.|English
LJ010-0297|But there were other notorious cases of forgery.|English
LJ010-0298|That of Fauntleroy the banker, in eighteen twenty-four,|English
LJ010-0299|caused much excitement at the time on account of the magnitude of the fraud, and the seeming probity of the culprit.|English
LJ010-0300|Mr. Fauntleroy was a member of a banking firm, which his father had established in conjunction with a gentleman of the name of Marsh, and others.|English
LJ010-0301|He had entered the house as clerk in eighteen hundred;|English
LJ010-0302|in eighteen oh seven, and when only twenty-two, he succeeded to his father's share in the business.|English
LJ010-0303|According to Fauntleroy's own case, he found at once that the firm was heavily involved,|English
LJ010-0304|through advances made to various builders, and that it could only maintain its credit by wholesale discounting.|English
LJ010-0305|Its embarrassments were greatly increased by the bankruptcy of two of its clients in the building trade,|English
LJ010-0306|and the bank became liable for a sum of one hundred seventy thousand pounds.|English
LJ010-0307|New liabilities were incurred to the extent of one hundred thousand pounds by more failures, and in eighteen nineteen,|English
LJ010-0308|by the death of one of the partners, a large sum in cash had to be withdrawn from the bank to pay his heirs.|English
LJ010-0309|During these numerous and trying difficulties -- it is Mr. Fauntleroy who speaks --|English
LJ010-0310|the house was nearly without resources, and the whole burthen of management falling on me, I sought resources where I could;|English
LJ010-0311|in other words, he forged powers of attorney, and proceeded to realize securities lodged in his bank under various names.|English
LJ010-0312|Among the prisoner's private papers, one was found giving full details of the stock he had feloniously sold out,|English
LJ010-0313|the sum total amounting to some one hundred seventy thousand pounds, with a declaration in his own handwriting to the following effect.|English
LJ010-0314|In order to keep up the credit of our house, I have forged powers of attorney for the above sums and parties,|English
LJ010-0315|and sold out to the amount here stated, and without the knowledge of my partners.|English
LJ010-0316|I kept up the payments of the dividends, but made no entries of such payments in my books.|English
LJ010-0317|The bank began first to refuse our acceptances, and to destroy the credit of our house; the bank shall smart for it.|English
LJ011-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section fourteen: Newgate notorieties, part one|English
LJ011-0002|Many stories were in circulation at the time of Fauntleroy's trial with regard to his forgeries. It was said that he had by means of them|English
LJ011-0003|sold out so large an amount of stock, that he paid sixteen thousand pounds a year in dividends to escape detection.|English
LJ011-0004|Once he ran a narrow risk of being found out.|English
LJ011-0005|A lady in the country, who had thirteen thousand pounds in the stocks, desired her London agent to sell them out.|English
LJ011-0006|He went to the bank, and found that no stocks stood in her name. He called at once upon Fauntleroy, his client's bankers, for an explanation,|English
LJ011-0007|"and was told by Mr. Fauntleroy that the lady had desired him to sell out, ""which I have done,"" added the fraudulent banker, ""and here are the proceeds,"""|English
LJ011-0008|whereupon he produced exchequer bills to the amount.|English
LJ011-0009|Nothing more was heard of the affair, although the lady declared that she had never instructed Fauntleroy to sell.|English
LJ011-0010|On another occasion the banker forged a gentleman's name while the latter was sitting with him in his private room,|English
LJ011-0011|and took the instrument out to a clerk with the ink not dry.|English
LJ011-0012|It must be added that the Bank of England, on discovering the forgeries,|English
LJ011-0013|replaced the stock in the names of the original holders, who might otherwise have been completely ruined.|English
LJ011-0014|A newspaper report of the time describes Fauntleroy as a well-made man of middle stature.|English
LJ011-0015|His hair, though gray, was thick, and lay smooth over his forehead.|English
LJ011-0016|His countenance had an expression of most subdued resignation.|English
LJ011-0017|The impression which his appearance altogether was calculated to make was that of the profoundest commiseration.|English
LJ011-0018|The crime, long carried on without detection, was first discovered in eighteen twenty,|English
LJ011-0019|when it was found that a sum of ten thousand pounds, standing in the name of three trustees, of whom Fauntleroy was one,|English
LJ011-0020|had been sold out under a forged power of attorney.|English
LJ011-0021|Further investigations brought other similar frauds to light,|English
LJ011-0022|and fixed the whole sum misappropriated at one hundred seventy thousand pounds, the first forgery dating back to eighteen fourteen.|English
LJ011-0023|A run upon the bank immediately followed, which was only met by a suspension of payment and the closing of its doors.|English
LJ011-0024|Meanwhile public gossip was busy with Fauntleroy's name,|English
LJ011-0025|and it was openly stated in the press and in conversation that the proceeds of these frauds had been squandered in chambering, gambling, and debauchery.|English
LJ011-0026|Fauntleroy was scouted as a licentious libertine, a deep and determined gamester, a spendthrift whose extravagance knew no bounds.|English
LJ011-0027|The veil was lifted from his private life, and he was accused of persistent immorality.|English
LJ011-0028|In his defense|English
LJ011-0029|he sought to rebut these charges, which indeed were never clearly made out, and it is pretty certain that his own account of the causes which led him into dishonesty|English
LJ011-0030|was substantially true|English
LJ011-0031|He called many witnesses, seventeen in all, to speak of him as they had found him; and these, all respectable city merchants and business men,|English
LJ011-0032|declared that they had hitherto formed a high opinion of his honor, integrity, and goodness of disposition,|English
LJ011-0033|deeming him the last person capable of a dishonorable action.|English
LJ011-0034|These arguments availed little with the jury, who after a short deliberation found Fauntleroy guilty, and he was sentenced to death.|English
LJ011-0035|Every endeavor was used, however, to obtain a commutation of sentence. His case was twice argued before the judges on points of law,|English
LJ011-0036|but the result in both cases was unfavorable.|English
LJ011-0037|Appeals were made to the Home Secretary, and all possible political interest brought to bear, but without success.|English
LJ011-0038|Fauntleroy meanwhile lay in Newgate, not herded with other condemned prisoners, as the custom was,|English
LJ011-0039|but in a separate chamber, that belonging to one of the warders of the jail.|English
LJ011-0040|I find in the chaplain's journal, under date eighteen twenty-four, various entries relative to this prisoner.|English
LJ011-0041|Visited Mr. Fauntleroy. My application for books for him not having been attended, I had no prayer-book to give him.|English
LJ011-0042|Visited Mr. Fauntleroy. The sheriffs have very kindly permitted him to remain in the turnkey's room where he was originally placed; nor can I omit expressing a hope|English
LJ011-0043|that this may prove the beginning of a better system of confinement, and that every description of persons who may be unfortunately under sentence of death|English
LJ011-0044|will no longer be herded indiscriminately together.|English
LJ011-0045|The kindliness of the city authorities to Fauntleroy was not limited to the assignment of a separate place of durance.|English
LJ011-0046|As I have already said, they took the chaplain seriously to task for the bad taste shown in the condemned sermon preached before Fauntleroy.|English
LJ011-0047|This was on the text,|English
LJ011-0048|"Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall,"" and was full of the most pointed allusions to the culprit."|English
LJ011-0049|Fauntleroy constantly groaned aloud while the sermon proceeded, and contemporary reports declared|English
LJ011-0050|that he appeared to feel deeply the force of the reverend gentleman's observations, especially when the chaplain spoke of|English
LJ011-0051|the great magnitude of our erring brother's offense, one of the most dangerous description in a trading community.|English
LJ011-0052|The sermon ended with an appeal to the dying man, exhorting him to penitence.|English
LJ011-0053|"This ""personality,"" and it can be called by no other name, is carefully excluded from prison pulpit utterances on the eve of an execution."|English
LJ011-0054|A very curious and, in its way, amusing circumstance in connection with this case was the offer of a certain Italian,|English
LJ011-0055|Edmund Angelini, to take Fauntleroy's place.|English
LJ011-0056|Angelini wrote to the Lord Mayor to this effect,|English
LJ011-0057|"urging that Fauntleroy was a father, a citizen: ""his life is useful, mine a burthen, to the State."""|English
LJ011-0058|"He was summoned to the Mansion House, where he repeated his request, crying, ""Accordez moi cette grâce,"" with much urgency."|English
LJ011-0059|There were doubts of his sanity.|English
LJ011-0060|He wrote afterwards to the effect that the moment he had offered himself, an unknown assassin came to aim a blow at him.|English
LJ011-0061|Let this monster give his name; I am ready to fight him. I am still determined to put myself in the place of Mr. Fauntleroy.|English
LJ011-0062|If the law of this country can receive such a sacrifice, my death will render to heaven an innocent man, and to earth a repentant sinner.|English
LJ011-0063|Fauntleroy was not entirely dependent upon the ordinary for ghostly counsel in his extremity.|English
LJ011-0064|He was also attended by the Rev. Mr. Springett and the indefatigable Mr. Baker, whose name has already been mentioned.|English
LJ011-0065|When led out on the morning of his execution, these two last-named gentlemen each took hold of one of his arms, and so accompanied him to the scaffold.|English
LJ011-0066|The concourse in front of Newgate was enormous, but much sympathy was evinced for this unfortunate victim to human weakness and ruthless laws.|English
LJ011-0067|A report was, moreover, widely circulated, and the impression long prevailed, that he actually escaped death.|English
LJ011-0068|It was said that strangulation had been prevented by the insertion of a silver tube in his wind-pipe,|English
LJ011-0069|and that after hanging for the regulated time he was taken down and easily restored to consciousness.|English
LJ011-0070|Afterwards, according to the common rumor, he went abroad and lived there for many years; but the story is not only wholly unsubstantiated,|English
LJ011-0071|but there is good evidence to show that the body after execution was handed over to his friends and interred privately.|English
LJ011-0072|Some years were still to elapse before capital punishment ceased to be the penalty for forgery, and in the interval|English
LJ011-0073|several persons were sentenced to or suffered death for this crime.|English
LJ011-0074|There were two notable capital convictions for forgery in eighteen twenty-eight.|English
LJ011-0075|One was that of Captain Montgomery, who assumed the aliases of Colonel Wallace and Colonel Morgan.|English
LJ011-0076|His offense was uttering forged notes, and there was strong suspicion that he had long subsisted entirely by this fraud.|English
LJ011-0077|The act for which he was taken into custody was the payment of a forged ten-pound note for half-a-dozen silver spoons.|English
LJ011-0078|Montgomery was an adept at forgery. He had gone wrong early. Although born of respectable parents, and gazetted to a commission in the army,|English
LJ011-0079|he soon left the service and betook himself to dishonest ways.|English
LJ011-0080|His first forgery was the marvelous imitation of the signature of the Hon. Mr. Neville, M.P., who wrote an extremely cramped and curious hand.|English
LJ011-0081|He was not prosecuted for this fraud on account of the respectability of his family, and soon after this escape|English
LJ011-0082|he came to London, where he practiced as a professional swindler and cheat.|English
LJ011-0083|For a long time justice did not overtake him for any criminal offense, but he was frequently in Newgate and in the King's Bench for debt.|English
LJ011-0084|After three years' confinement in the latter prison he passed himself off as his brother, Colonel Montgomery,|English
LJ011-0085|a distinguished officer, and would have married an heiress had not the imposture been discovered in time.|English
LJ011-0086|He then took to forging bank-notes, and was arrested as I have described above.|English
LJ011-0087|Montgomery was duly sentenced to death, but he preferred suicide to the gallows. After sentence his demeanor was serious yet firm.|English
LJ011-0088|The night previous to that fixed for his execution he wrote several letters, one of them being to Edward Gibbon Wakefield, a fellow-prisoner,|English
LJ011-0089|and listened attentively to the ordinary, who read him the well-known address written and delivered by Dr. Dodd previous to his own execution for forgery.|English
LJ011-0090|But next morning he was found dead in his cell.|English
LJ011-0091|"In one corner after much search a phial was found labeled ""Prussic acid,"""|English
LJ011-0092|which it was asserted he had been in the habit of carrying about his person ever since he had taken to passing forged notes, as an antidote against disgrace.|English
LJ011-0093|This phial he had managed to retain in his possession in spite of the frequent searches to which he was subjected in Newgate.|English
LJ011-0094|The second conviction for forgery in eighteen twenty-eight was that of the Quaker Joseph Hunton, a man of previously the highest repute in the city of London.|English
LJ011-0095|He had prospered in early life, was a slop-seller on a large scale at Bury St. Edmunds, and a sugar-baker in the metropolis.|English
LJ011-0096|He married a lady also belonging to the Society of Friends, who brought him a large fortune, which, and his own money, he put into a city firm,|English
LJ011-0097|that of Dickson and Co.|English
LJ011-0098|He soon, however, became deeply involved in Stock Exchange speculations,|English
LJ011-0099|and losing heavily, to meet the claims upon him he put out a number of forged bills of exchange or acceptances,|English
LJ011-0100|to which the signature of one Wilkins of Abingdon was found to be forged.|English
LJ011-0101|Hunton tried to fly the country on the detection of the fraud, but was arrested at Plymouth just as he was on the point of leaving England in the New York packet.|English
LJ011-0102|He had gone on board in his Quaker dress, but when captured was found in a light-green frock,|English
LJ011-0103|a pair of light gray pantaloons, a black stock and a foraging cap.|English
LJ011-0104|Hunton was put upon his trial at the Old Bailey, and in due course sentenced to death.|English
LJ011-0105|His defense was that the forged acceptances would have been met on coming to maturity, and that he had no real desire to defraud.|English
LJ011-0106|Hunton accepted his sentence with great resignation, although he protested against the inhumanity of the laws which condemned him to death.|English
LJ011-0107|On entering Newgate he said,|English
LJ011-0108|I wish after this day to have communication with nobody; let me take leave of my wife, and family, and friends. I have already suffered an execution;|English
LJ011-0109|my heart has undergone that horrible penalty.|English
LJ011-0110|He was, however, visited by and received his wife, and several members of the Society of Friends.|English
LJ011-0111|Two elders of the meeting sat up with him in the press yard the whole of the night previous to execution, and a third,|English
LJ011-0112|Mr. Sparks Moline, came to attend him to the scaffold.|English
LJ011-0113|He met his death with unshaken firmness, only entreating that a certain blue handkerchief,|English
LJ011-0114|to which he seemed fondly attached, should be used to bandage his eyes, which request was readily granted.|English
LJ011-0115|Hunton's execution no doubt aroused public attention to the cruelty and futility of the capital law against forgery.|English
LJ011-0116|A society which had already been started against capital punishment|English
LJ011-0117|devoted its efforts first to a mitigation of the forgery statute, but could not immediately accomplish much.|English
LJ011-0118|In eighteen twenty-nine the gallows claimed two more victims for this offense.|English
LJ011-0119|One was Richard Gifford, a well-educated youth who had been at Christ's Hospital, and afterwards in the National Debt Office.|English
LJ011-0120|Unfortunately he took to drink, lost his appointment, and fell from bad to worse.|English
LJ011-0121|Suddenly, after being at the lowest depths, he emerged, and was found by his friends living in comfort in the Waterloo Road.|English
LJ011-0122|His funds, which he pretended came to him with a rich wife, were really the proceeds of frauds upon the Bank of England.|English
LJ011-0123|He forged the names of people who held stock on the Bank books, and got the value of the stock;|English
LJ011-0124|he also forged dividend receipts and got the dividends. He was only six-and-twenty when he was hanged.|English
LJ011-0125|The other and the last criminal executed for forgery in this country was one Maynard, who was convicted of a fraud upon the Custom House.|English
LJ011-0126|In conjunction with two others, one of whom was a clerk in the Custom House,|English
LJ011-0127|and had access to the official records, he forged a warrant for one thousand nine-hundred seventy-three pounds and was paid the money by the comptroller general.|English
LJ011-0128|Maynard was convicted of uttering the forged document, Jones of being an accessory; the third prisoner was acquitted.|English
LJ011-0129|Maynard was the only one who suffered death.|English
LJ011-0130|This was on the last day of eighteen twenty-nine. In the following session Sir Robert Peel brought in a bill to consolidate the acts relating to forgery.|English
LJ011-0131|Upon the third reading of this bill Sir James Macintosh moved as an amendment that capital punishment should be abolished for all crimes of forgery,|English
LJ011-0132|except the forgery of wills and powers of attorney.|English
LJ011-0133|This amendment was strongly supported outside the House, and a petition in favor of its passing was presented,|English
LJ011-0134|signed by more than a thousand members of banking firms.|English
LJ011-0135|Macintosh's amendment was carried in the Commons, but the new law did not pass the Lords, who re-enacted the capital penalty.|English
LJ011-0136|Still no sentence of death was carried out for the offense, and in eighteen thirty-two|English
LJ011-0137|the Attorney-General introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment entirely for forgery.|English
LJ011-0138|It passed the Commons, but opposition was again encountered in the Lords.|English
LJ011-0139|This time they sent back the bill, re-enacting only the two penalties for will forging and the forging of powers of attorney;|English
LJ011-0140|in other words, they had advanced in eighteen thirty-two to the point at which the Lower House had arrived in eighteen thirty.|English
LJ011-0141|There were at the moment in Newgate six convicts sentenced to death for forging wills.|English
LJ011-0142|The question was whether the Government would dare to take their lives at the bidding of the House of Lords,|English
LJ011-0143|and in defiance of the vote of the assembly which more accurately represented public opinion. It was indeed announced that their fate was sealed;|English
LJ011-0144|but Mr. Joseph Hume pressed the Government hard, and obtained an assurance that the men should not be executed.|English
LJ011-0145|The new Forgery Act with the Lords' amendment passed into law, but the latter proved perfectly harmless,|English
LJ011-0146|and no person ever after suffered death for any variety of this crime.|English
LJ011-0147|I will include in this part of the present chapter almost one of the last instances of a crime which in time past|English
LJ011-0148|had invariably been visited with the death penalty, and which was of a distinctly fraudulent nature.|English
LJ011-0149|The abduction of Miss Turner by the brothers Wakefield bore a strong resemblance to the carrying off and forcible marrying of heiresses as already described.|English
LJ011-0150|Miss Turner was a school-girl of barely fifteen,|English
LJ011-0151|only child of a gentleman of large property in Cheshire, of which county he was actually high sheriff at the time of his daughter's abduction.|English
LJ011-0152|The elder brother,|English
LJ011-0153|Edward Gibbon Wakefield, the prime mover in the abduction, was a barrister, not exactly briefless, but without a large practice.|English
LJ011-0154|He had, it was said, a good private income, and was already a widower with two children at the time of his committing the offense for which he was subsequently tried.|English
LJ011-0155|He had eloped with his first wife from school.|English
LJ011-0156|While on a visit to Macclesfield he heard by chance of Miss Turner, and that she would inherit all her father's possessions.|English
LJ011-0157|He thereupon conceived an idea of carrying her off and marrying her willy nilly at Gretna Green.|English
LJ011-0158|The two brothers started at once for Liverpool, where Miss Turner was at school with a Mrs. Daulby.|English
LJ011-0159|At Manchester, en route, a traveling carriage was purchased, which was driven up to Mrs. Daulby's door at eight in the morning,|English
LJ011-0160|and a servant hurriedly alighted from it, bearing a letter for Miss Turner.|English
LJ011-0161|This purported to be from the medical attendant of Mr. Turner, written at Shrigley, Mr. Turner's place of residence;|English
LJ011-0162|and it stated that Mrs. Turner had been stricken with paralysis.|English
LJ011-0163|"She was not in immediate danger, but she wished to see her daughter, ""as it was possible she might soon become incapable of recognizing any one."""|English
LJ011-0164|Miss Turner, greatly agitated, accompanied the messenger who had brought this news, a disguised servant of Wakefield's,|English
LJ011-0165|who had plausibly explained that he had only recently been engaged at Shrigley.|English
LJ011-0166|The road taken was via Manchester, where the servant said a Dr. Hull was to be picked up to go on with them to Shrigley.|English
LJ011-0167|At Manchester, however, the carriage stopped at the Albion Hotel.|English
LJ011-0168|Miss Turner was shown into a private room, where Mr. Wakefield soon presented himself.|English
LJ011-0169|Miss Turner, not knowing him, would have left the room, but he said he came from her father, and she remained.|English
LJ011-0170|Wakefield, in reply to her inquiries, satisfied her that her mother was well, and that the real reason for summoning her from school|English
LJ011-0171|was the state of her father's affairs.|English
LJ011-0172|Mr. Turner was on the verge of bankruptcy. He was at that moment at Kendal, and wished her to join him there at once.|English
LJ011-0173|Miss Turner consented to go on, and they traveled night and day towards the north.|English
LJ011-0174|But at Kendal there was no Mr. Turner, and, to allay Miss Turner's growing anxiety,|English
LJ011-0175|Wakefield found it necessary to become more explicit regarding her father's affairs.|English
LJ011-0176|He now pretended that Mr. Turner was also on his way to the border, pursued by sheriffs' officers.|English
LJ011-0177|The fact was, Wakefield went on to say, an uncle of his had advanced Mr. Turner sixty thousand pounds, which had temporarily staved off ruin.|English
LJ011-0178|But another bank had since failed, and nothing could save Mr. Turner but the transfer of some property to Miss Turner, and its settlement on her,|English
LJ011-0179|"so that it might become the exclusive property of her husband, ""whoever he might be."""|English
LJ011-0180|Wakefield added that it had been suggested he should marry Miss Turner, but that he had laughed at the idea.|English
LJ011-0181|Wakefield's uncle took the matter more seriously, and declared that unless the marriage came off Mr. Turner must be sold up.|English
LJ011-0182|Miss Turner, thus pressed, consented to go on to Gretna Green.|English
LJ011-0183|Passing through Carlisle, she was told that Mr. Turner was in the town, but could not show himself.|English
LJ011-0184|Nothing could release him from his trouble but the arrival of the marriage certificate from Gretna Green.|English
LJ011-0185|Filial affection rose superior to all scruples, and Miss Turner, having crossed the border, was married to Wakefield|English
LJ011-0186|by the blacksmith in the usual way.|English
LJ011-0187|Returning to Carlisle, she now heard that her father had been set free, and had gone home to Shrigley, whither they were to follow him.|English
LJ011-0188|They set out, but at Leeds Wakefield found himself called suddenly to Paris;|English
LJ011-0189|the other brother was accordingly sent on a pretended mission to Shrigley to bring Mr. Turner on to London, whither Wakefield and Miss Turner also proceeded.|English
LJ011-0190|On arrival, Wakefield pretended that they had missed Mr. Turner, and must follow him over to France.|English
LJ011-0191|The strangely-married couple thereupon pressed on to Dover, and crossed over to Calais.|English
LJ011-0192|The fact of the abduction did not transpire for some days.|English
LJ011-0193|Then Mrs. Daulby learnt that Miss Turner had not arrived at Shrigley, but that she had gone to Manchester.|English
LJ011-0194|Friends went in pursuit and traced her to Huddersfield and further north.|English
LJ011-0195|The terror and dismay of her parents were soon intensified by the receipt of a letter from Wakefield, at Carlisle, announcing the marriage.|English
LJ011-0196|Mr. Turner at once set off for London, where he sought the assistance of the police,|English
LJ011-0197|and presently ascertained that Wakefield had gone to the Continent with his involuntary bride.|English
LJ011-0198|An uncle of Miss Wakefield's, accompanied by his solicitor and a Bow Street runner, at once went in pursuit.|English
LJ011-0199|Meanwhile, a second letter turned up from Wakefield at Calais, in which he assured Mrs. Turner that Miss Turner was fondly attached to him,|English
LJ011-0200|"and went on to say, ""I do assure you, madam, that it shall be the anxious endeavor of my life to promote her happiness by every means in my power."""|English
LJ011-0201|The game, however, was nearly up. Miss Turner was met by her uncle on Calais pier as she was walking with Wakefield.|English
LJ011-0202|The uncle claimed her. The husband resisted.|English
LJ011-0203|Monsieur le Maire was appealed to, and decided to leave it to the young lady, who at once abandoned Wakefield.|English
LJ011-0204|"As he still urged his rights over his wife, Miss Turner cried out in protest, ""No, no, I am not his wife;"|English
LJ011-0205|he carried me away by fraud and stratagem, and forced me to accompany him to Gretna Green|English
LJ011-0206|By the same forcible means I was compelled to quit England, and to trust myself to the protection of this person,|English
LJ011-0207|whom I never saw until I was taken from Liverpool, and never want to see again.|English
LJ011-0208|On this Wakefield gave in.|English
LJ011-0209|He surrendered the bride who had never been a wife, and she returned to England with her friends, while Wakefield went on alone to Paris.|English
LJ011-0210|Mr. William Wakefield was arrested at Dover, conveyed to Chester, and committed to Lancaster Jail for trial at the next assizes,|English
LJ011-0211|"when indictments were preferred against both brothers ""for having carried away Ellen Turner, spinster,"|English
LJ011-0212|then a maid and heir apparent unto her father, for the sake of the lucre of her substance; and for having afterwards unlawfully and against her will|English
LJ011-0213|married the said Ellen Turner.|English
LJ011-0214|They were tried in March of the following year, Edward Wakefield having apparently given himself up,|English
LJ011-0215|and found guilty, remaining in Lancaster Jail for a couple of months, when they were brought up to the court of King's Bench for judgment.|English
LJ011-0216|The prosecution pressed for a severe penalty. Edward Wakefield pleaded that his trial had already cost him three thousand pounds.|English
LJ011-0217|Mr. Justice Bayley, in summing up,|English
LJ011-0218|spoke severely of the gross deception practiced upon an innocent girl, and sentenced the brothers each to three years' imprisonment,|English
LJ011-0219|William Wakefield in Lancaster Jail, and Edward Gibbon Wakefield in Newgate, which sentences were duly enforced.|English
LJ011-0220|The marriage was annulled by an Act of Parliament, although Wakefield petitioned against it,|English
LJ011-0221|and was brought from Newgate, at his own request, to oppose the second reading of the bill.|English
LJ011-0222|He also wrote and published a pamphlet from the jail to show that Miss Turner had been a consenting party to the marriage, and was really his wife.|English
LJ011-0223|Neither his address nor his pamphlet availed much, for the bill for the divorce passed both Houses.|English
LJ011-0224|That Mr. Wakefield was a shrewd critic and close observer of all that went on in the Newgate of those days,|English
LJ011-0225|"will be admitted by those who have read his book on ""the punishment of death,"|English
LJ011-0226|which was based on his jail experiences, and of which I have availed myself in the last chapter.|English
LJ011-0227|After their release from Lancaster and Newgate respectively, both Wakefields went abroad.|English
LJ011-0228|Mr. W. Wakefield served in a continental army, and rose to the rank of colonel,|English
LJ011-0229|after which he went to New Zealand, and held an important post in that colony.|English
LJ011-0230|Mr. E. G. Wakefield took part in the scheme for the colonization of North Australia, and for some years resided in that colony.|English
LJ011-0231|Miss Turner subsequently married Mr. Legh of Lym Hall, Cheshire.|English
LJ011-0232|It must not be imagined that although highway robbery was now nearly extinct, and felonious outrages in the streets were rare,|English
LJ011-0233|that thieves or depredators were idle or entirely unsuccessful.|English
LJ011-0234|"Bigger ""jobs"" than ever were planned and attempted,"|English
LJ011-0235|as in the burglary at Lambeth Palace, when the thieves were fortunately disappointed, the archbishop having, before he left town,|English
LJ011-0236|sent his plate-chests, eight in number, to the silversmith's for greater security.|English
LJ011-0237|The jewelers were always a favorite prey of the London thieves.|English
LJ011-0238|Shops were broken into, as when that of Grimaldi and Johnson, in the Strand, was robbed of watches to the value of six thousand pounds.|English
LJ011-0239|Where robbery with violence was intended, the perpetrators had now to adopt various shifts and contrivances to secure their victim.|English
LJ011-0240|No more curious instance of this ever occurred than the assault made by one Howard upon a Mr. Mullay, with intent to rob him.|English
LJ011-0241|The latter had advertised, offering a sum of one thousand pounds to anyone who would introduce him to some mercantile equipment.|English
LJ011-0242|Howard replied, desiring Mr. Mullay to call upon him in a house in Red Lion Square.|English
LJ011-0243|Mr. Mullay went, and a second interview was agreed upon, when a third person, Mr. Owen,|English
LJ011-0244|through whose interest an appointment under Government was to be obtained for Mullay, would be present.|English
LJ011-0245|Mr. Mullay called again, taking with him five hundred pounds in cash. Howard discovered this, and his manner was very suspicious;|English
LJ011-0246|there were weapons in the room -- a long knife, a heavy trap-ball bat, and a poker.|English
LJ011-0247|Mr. Mullay became alarmed, and as Mr. Owen did not appear, withdrew;|English
LJ011-0248|Howard, strange to say, making no attempt to detain him; probably because Mullay promised to return a few days later, and to bring more money.|English
LJ011-0249|On this renewed visit Mr. Owen was still absent, and Mr. Mullay agreed to write him a note from a copy Howard gave him.|English
LJ011-0250|While thus engaged, Howard thrust the poker into the fire.|English
LJ011-0251|Mullay protested, and then Howard, under the influence of ungovernable rage, as it seemed, jumped up,|English
LJ011-0252|locked the door, and attacked Mullay violently with the trap-ball bat and knife.|English
LJ011-0253|Mullay defended himself, and managed to break the knife, but not before he had cut himself severely.|English
LJ011-0254|"A life and death struggle ensued. Mullay cried ""Murder!"""|English
LJ011-0255|Howard swore he would finish him, but proved the weaker of the two, and Mullay got him down on the floor.|English
LJ011-0256|By this time the neighbors were aroused, and several people came to the scene of the affray.|English
LJ011-0257|Howard was secured, given into custody, and committed to Newgate.|English
LJ011-0258|The defense he set up was, that Mullay had used epithets towards him while they were negotiating a business matter,|English
LJ011-0259|and that, being an irritable temper, he had struck Mullay, after which a violent scuffle took place.|English
LJ011-0260|It was, however, proved that Howard was in needy circumstances, and that his proposals to Mr. Mullay could only have originated in a desire to rob him.|English
LJ011-0261|He was found guilty of an assault with intent, and sentenced to transportation for fourteen years.|English
LJ011-0262|A more complicated and altogether most extraordinary case of assault, with intent to extort money, occurred a few years later.|English
LJ011-0263|It was perpetrated upon a respectable country solicitor,|English
LJ011-0264|Mr. Gee, of Bishop Stortford, who administered the estate of a certain Mr. Canning, deceased.|English
LJ011-0265|This Mr. Canning had left his widow a life interest in two thousand pounds so long as she remained unmarried.|English
LJ011-0266|The money went after her to her children.|English
LJ011-0267|Mr. Gee had invested one thousand two hundred pounds of this, and was seeking how best to place the remaining eight hundred pounds,|English
LJ011-0268|when he was asked to meet a Mr. Heath in London with regard to the sale of certain lands at Bishop Stortford.|English
LJ011-0269|An appointment was made and kept by Mr. Gee,|English
LJ011-0270|but on arrival he was met by a young sailor with a letter which begged Mr. Gee to go to Heath's house, as the latter was not well.|English
LJ011-0271|Mr. Gee went in the coach sent for him, and alighted at twenty-seven, York Street, West, Commercial Road.|English
LJ011-0272|The coach immediately drove off; Mr. Gee entered the house, asked for Mr. Heath, was told he would find him in the back kitchen at breakfast.|English
LJ011-0273|He was about to descend the stairs when three persons, one of them the young sailor,|English
LJ011-0274|fell upon him, and in spite of his resistance carried him into a sort of den partitioned off at the end of the back kitchen.|English
LJ011-0275|There he was seated on some sort of wooden bench and securely fastened.|English
LJ011-0276|A chain fixed to staples at his back passed round his chest under his arms, and was padlocked on the left side;|English
LJ011-0277|his feet were bound with cords and made fast to rings in the floor. Thus manacled, one of the party, who pretended to be Mrs. Canning's brother,|English
LJ011-0278|addressed him, insisting that he should forthwith sign a cheque for the eight hundred pounds of the Canning inheritance still uninvested,|English
LJ011-0279|and write an order sufficient to secure the surrender of the other one thousand two hundred pounds.|English
LJ011-0280|Mr. Gee at first stoutly refused.|English
LJ011-0281|Then, as they warned him that he would be kept a prisoner in total darkness in this horrible den until he agreed to their demands,|English
LJ011-0282|he gave in, and signed the documents thus illegally extorted.|English
LJ011-0283|One was a cheque for eight hundred pounds on his bankers, the other an order to Mr. Bell of Newport, Essex, requesting the surrender of a deed.|English
LJ011-0284|His captors having thus succeeded in their designs, left him, no doubt to realize the money.|English
LJ011-0285|The door of his place of durance stood open, and Mr. Gee began to consider whether he might not escape.|English
LJ011-0286|For three hours he struggled without success with his bonds,|English
LJ011-0287|but at length managed to wriggle out of the chain which confined his body, and soon loosened the ropes round his feet.|English
LJ011-0288|Thus free, he eluded the vigilance of two of the party, who were at dinner in the front kitchen,|English
LJ011-0289|and creeping out into the garden at the back, climbed the wall, and got into the street.|English
LJ011-0290|His first act was to send a messenger to stop the cheque and the order to Mr. Bell, his next to seek the help of the police.|English
LJ011-0291|Two Bow Street runners were dispatched to the house in York Street, which had evidently been taken on purpose for the outrage.|English
LJ011-0292|There was no furniture in the place, and the den in the kitchen had been recently and specially constructed of boards of immense strength and thickness.|English
LJ011-0293|It was a cell five feet by three, within another, the intervening being filled with rammed earth to deaden the sound.|English
LJ012-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section fifteen: Newgate notorieties, part three|English
LJ012-0002|On the arrival of the police the house was empty.|English
LJ012-0003|The two men on guard had gone off immediately after Mr. Gee had escaped, but they returned later in the day, and were apprehended.|English
LJ012-0004|Inquiries set on foot also elicited the suspicion that the person who had represented Mrs. Canning's brother|English
LJ012-0005|was a blind man named Edwards, who had taken this house in York Street, and who was known to be a frequent visitor at Mrs. Canning's.|English
LJ012-0006|A watch was set on him at her house, where he was soon afterwards arrested.|English
LJ012-0007|Edwards, whom Mr. Gee easily identified with the others, at once admitted that he was the prime mover of the conspiracy.|English
LJ012-0008|He had sought by all legal means to obtain possession of the two thousand pounds, but had failed, and had had recourse to more violent means.|English
LJ012-0009|It turned out that he was really married to Mrs. Canning,|English
LJ012-0010|both having been recognized by the clergyman who had performed the ceremony, and the assault had been committed to secure the money|English
LJ012-0011|which Mrs. Canning had lost by remarriage.|English
LJ012-0012|All three men were committed for trial, although Edwards wished to exculpate the others as having only acted under his order.|English
LJ012-0013|At the trial the indictment charging them with felony could not be sustained, but they were found guilty of conspiracy and assault.|English
LJ012-0014|Edwards was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Newgate,|English
LJ012-0015|Weedon and Lecasser to twelve and six months respectively in Coldbath Fields.|English
LJ012-0016|At no period could thieves in London or elsewhere have prospered had they been unable to dispose of their ill-gotten goods.|English
LJ012-0017|The trade of fence, or receiver, therefore, is very nearly as old as the crimes which it so obviously fostered.|English
LJ012-0018|One of the most notorious, and for a time most successful practitioners in this illicit trade, passed through Newgate in eighteen thirty-one.|English
LJ012-0019|The name of Ikey Solomons was long remembered by thief and thief-taker.|English
LJ012-0020|He began as an itinerant street vendor at eight, at ten he passed bad money,|English
LJ012-0021|"at fourteen he was a pickpocket and a ""duffer,"" or a seller of sham goods."|English
LJ012-0022|He early saw the profits to be made out of purchasing stolen goods, but could not embark in it at first for want of capital.|English
LJ012-0023|He was taken up when still in his teens for stealing a pocketbook, and was sentenced to transportation, but did not get beyond the hulks at Chatham.|English
LJ012-0024|"On his release an uncle, a slop-seller in Chatham, gave him a situation as ""barker,"" or salesman,"|English
LJ012-0025|at which he realized one hundred fifty pounds within a couple of years.|English
LJ012-0026|With this capital he returned to London and set up as a fence.|English
LJ012-0027|He had such great aptitude for business, and such a thorough knowledge of the real value of goods,|English
LJ012-0028|that he was soon admitted to be one of the best judges known of all kinds of property, from a glass bottle to a five hundred guinea chronometer.|English
LJ012-0029|But he never paid more than a fixed price for all articles of the same class, whatever their intrinsic value.|English
LJ012-0030|Thus, a watch was paid for as a watch, whether it was of gold or silver; a piece of linen as such, whether the stuff was coarse or fine.|English
LJ012-0031|This rule in dealing with stolen goods continues to this day, and has made the fortune of many since Ikey.|English
LJ012-0032|Solomons also established a system of provincial agency, by which stolen goods were passed on from London to the seaports, and so abroad.|English
LJ012-0033|Jewels were re-set,|English
LJ012-0034|diamonds refaced; all marks by which other articles might be identified, the selvages of linen, the stamps on shoes,|English
LJ012-0035|the number and names on watches, were carefully removed or obliterated after the goods passed out of his hands.|English
LJ012-0036|On one occasion the whole of the proceeds of a robbery from a boot shop was traced to Solomons';|English
LJ012-0037|the owner came with the police, and was morally convinced that it was his property,|English
LJ012-0038|but could not positively identify it, and Ikey defied them to remove a single shoe.|English
LJ012-0039|In the end the injured bootmaker agreed to buy back his stolen stock|English
LJ012-0040|at the price Solomons had paid for it, and it cost him about a hundred pounds to re-stock his shop with his own goods.|English
LJ012-0041|As a general rule Ikey Solomons confined his purchases to small articles, mostly of jewelery and plate,|English
LJ012-0042|which he kept concealed in a hiding-place with a trap-door just under his bed.|English
LJ012-0043|He lived in Rosemary Lane, and sometimes he had as much as twenty thousand pounds worth of goods secreted on the premises.|English
LJ012-0044|When his trade was busiest he set up a second establishment, at the head of which, although he was married,|English
LJ012-0045|he put another lady, with whom he was on intimate terms.|English
LJ012-0046|The second house was in Lower Queen Street, Islington, and he used it for some time as a depot for valuables.|English
LJ012-0047|But it was eventually discovered by Mrs. Solomons, a very jealous wife,|English
LJ012-0048|and this, with the danger arising from an extensive robbery of watches in Cheapside, in which Ikey was implicated as a receiver,|English
LJ012-0049|led him to think seriously of trying his fortunes in another land.|English
LJ012-0050|He was about to emigrate to New South Wales, when he was arrested at Islington and committed to Newgate on a charge of receiving stolen goods.|English
LJ012-0051|While thus incarcerated he managed to escape from custody, but not actually from jail, by an ingenious contrivance which is worth mentioning.|English
LJ012-0052|He claimed to be admitted to bail, and was taken from Newgate on a writ of habeas before one of the judges sitting at Westminster.|English
LJ012-0053|He was conveyed in a coach driven by a confederate, and under the escort of a couple of turnkeys.|English
LJ012-0054|"Solomons, while waiting to appear in court, persuaded the turnkeys to take him to a public-house, where all might ""refresh."""|English
LJ012-0055|While there he was joined by his wife and other friends.|English
LJ012-0056|After a short carouse the prisoner went into Westminster, his case was heard, bail refused, and he was ordered back to Newgate.|English
LJ012-0057|But he once more persuaded the turnkeys to pause at the public, where more liquor was consumed.|English
LJ012-0058|When the journey was resumed, Mrs. Solomons accompanied her husband in the coach. Half-way to Newgate she was taken with a fit.|English
LJ012-0059|One turnkey was stupidly drunk, and Ikey persuaded the other, who was not much better,|English
LJ012-0060|to let the coach change and pass Petticoat Lane en route to the jail, where the suffering woman might be handed over to her friends.|English
LJ012-0061|On stopping at a door in this low street, Ikey jumped out, ran into the house, slamming the door behind him.|English
LJ012-0062|He passed through and out at the back, and was soon beyond pursuit.|English
LJ012-0063|By-and-by the turnkeys, sobered by their loss, returned to Newgate alone, and pleaded in excuse that they had been drugged.|English
LJ012-0064|Ikey left no traces, and the police could hear nothing of him. He had in fact gone out of the country, to Copenhagen, whence he passed on to New York.|English
LJ012-0065|There he devoted himself to the circulation of forged notes. He was also anxious to do business in watches,|English
LJ012-0066|"and begged his wife to send him over a consignment of cheap ""righteous"" watches, or such as had been honestly obtained, and not ""on the cross."""|English
LJ012-0067|But Mrs. Solomons could not resist the temptation to dabble in stolen goods, and she was found shipping watches of the wrong category to New York.|English
LJ012-0068|For this she received a sentence of fourteen years' transportation, and was sent to Van Diemen's Land.|English
LJ012-0069|Ikey joined her at Hobart Town, where they set up a general shop, and soon began to prosper.|English
LJ012-0070|He was, however, recognized, and ere long an order came out from home for his arrest and transfer to England,|English
LJ012-0071|which presently followed, and again found himself an inmate of Newgate, waiting trial as a receiver and a prison-breaker.|English
LJ012-0072|He was indicted on eight charges, two only of which were substantiated, but on each of them he received a sentence of seven years' transportation.|English
LJ012-0073|At his own request he was reconveyed to Hobart Town, where his son had been carrying on the business.|English
LJ012-0074|"Whether Ikey was ""assigned"" to his own family is not recorded, but no doubt he succeeded to his own property when the term of servitude had expired."|English
LJ012-0075|No doubt, on the removal of Ikey Solomons from the scene, his mantle fell upon worthy successors.|English
LJ012-0076|There was an increase rather than an abatement in jewel and bullion robberies in the years immediately following,|English
LJ012-0077|and the thieves seem to have had no difficulty in disposing of their spoil.|English
LJ012-0078|One of the largest robberies of its class was that effected upon the Custom House in the winter of eighteen thirty-four.|English
LJ012-0079|A large amount of specie was nearly always retained here in the department of the Receiver of Fines.|English
LJ012-0080|This was known to some clerks in the office, who began to consider how they might lay hands on a lot of cash.|English
LJ012-0081|Being inexperienced, they decided to call in the services of a couple of professional housebreakers,|English
LJ012-0082|Jordan and Sullivan, who at once set to work in a business-like way to obtain impressions of the keys of the strong room and chest.|English
LJ012-0083|But before committing themselves to an attempt on the latter, it was of importance to ascertain how much it usually contained.|English
LJ012-0084|For this purpose Jordan waited on the receiver to make a small payment, for which he tendered a fifty-pound note.|English
LJ012-0085|The chest was opened to give change, and a heavy tray lifted out which plainly held some four thousand pounds in cash.|English
LJ012-0086|Some difficulty then arose as to gaining admission to the strong room, and it was arranged that a man, May, another Custom House clerk,|English
LJ012-0087|should be introduced into the building, and secreted there during the night to accomplish the robbery.|English
LJ012-0088|May was smuggled in through a window on the esplanade behind an opened umbrella. When the place was quite deserted|English
LJ012-0089|he broke open the chest and stole four thousand, seven hundred pounds in notes, with a quantity of gold and some silver.|English
LJ012-0090|He went out next morning with the booty when the doors were re-opened, and attracted no attention.|English
LJ012-0091|"The spoil was fairly divided; part of the notes were disposed of to a traveling ""receiver,"" who passed over to the Continent and there cashed them easily."|English
LJ012-0092|This occurred in November eighteen thirty-four. The Custom House officials were in a state of consternation,|English
LJ012-0093|and the police were unable at first to get on the track of the thieves.|English
LJ012-0094|While the excitement was still fresh, a new robbery of diamonds was committed at a bonded warehouse in the immediate neighborhood, on Custom House Quay.|English
LJ012-0095|The jewels had belonged to a Spanish countess recently deceased, who had sent them to England for greater security on the outbreak of the first Carlist war.|English
LJ012-0096|At her death the diamonds were divided between her four daughters, but only half had been claimed,|English
LJ012-0097|and at the time of the robbery there were still six thousand pounds worth in the warehouse.|English
LJ012-0098|These were deposited in an iron chest of great strength on the second floor.|English
LJ012-0099|The thieves it was supposed had secreted themselves in the warehouse during business hours, and waited till night to carry out their plans.|English
LJ012-0100|Some ham sandwiches, several cigar ends, and two empty champagne bottles were found on the premises next day, showing how they had passed their time.|English
LJ012-0101|They had had serious work to get at the diamonds. It was necessary to force one heavy door from its hinges, and to cut through the thick panels of another.|English
LJ012-0102|"The lock and fastenings of the chest were forced by means of a ""jack,"" an instrument known to housebreakers,"|English
LJ012-0103|which if introduced into a keyhole, and worked like a bit and brace, will soon destroy the strongest lock.|English
LJ012-0104|The thieves were satisfied with the diamonds; they broke open other cases containing gold watches and plate, but abstracted nothing.|English
LJ012-0105|The police were of opinion that these robberies were both the work of the same hand.|English
LJ012-0106|But it was not until the autumn that they traced some of the notes stolen from the Custom House to Jordan and Sullivan.|English
LJ012-0107|About this time also suspicion fell upon Huey, one of the clerks, who was arrested soon afterwards, and made a clean breast of the whole affair.|English
LJ012-0108|There was a hunt for the two well-known house-breakers, who were eventually heard of at a lodging in Kennington.|English
LJ012-0109|But they at once made tracks, and took up their residence under assumed names in a tavern in Bloomsbury.|English
LJ012-0110|The police lost all trace of them for some days, but at length Sullivan's brother was followed from the house in Kennington to the above-mentioned tavern.|English
LJ012-0111|Both the thieves were now apprehended, but only a small portion of the lost property was recovered,|English
LJ012-0112|notwithstanding a minute search through the room they had occupied.|English
LJ012-0113|After their arrest, Jordan's wife and Sullivan's brother came to the inn, and begged to be allowed to visit this room;|English
LJ012-0114|but their request, in spite of their earnest entreaties,|English
LJ012-0115|was refused, at the instigation of the police. A few days later a frequent guest at the tavern arrived, and had this same room allotted to him.|English
LJ012-0116|A fire was lit in it, and the maid in doing so threw a lot of rubbish, as it seemed, which had accumulated under the grate, on top of the burning coals.|English
LJ012-0117|By-and-by the occupant of the room noticed something glittering in the center of the fire, which, to inspect more closely, he took out with the tongs.|English
LJ012-0118|It was a large gold brooch set in pearls, but a portion of the mounting had melted with the heat.|English
LJ012-0119|The fire was raked out, and in the ashes were found seven large and four dozen small brilliants, also seven emeralds,|English
LJ012-0120|one of them of considerable size.|English
LJ012-0121|"A part of the ""swag"" stolen from the bonded warehouse was thus recovered, but it was supposed that a number of the stolen notes had perished in the fire."|English
LJ012-0122|The condign punishment meted out to these Custom House robbers had no deterrent effect seemingly.|English
LJ012-0123|Within three months, three new and most mysterious burglaries were committed at the West End, all in houses adjoining each other.|English
LJ012-0124|One was occupied by the Portuguese ambassador, who lost a quantity of jewelery from an escritoire, and his neighbors lost plate and cash.|English
LJ012-0125|"Not the slightest clue to these large affairs was ever obtained, but it is probable that they were ""put up"" jobs, or managed with the complicity of servants."|English
LJ012-0126|The next year twelve thousand sovereigns were cleverly stolen in the Mile End Road.|English
LJ012-0127|The gold-dust robbery of eighteen thirty-nine, the first of its kind, was cleverly and carefully planned with the assistance of a dishonest employee.|English
LJ012-0128|A young man named Caspar, clerk to a steam-ship company,|English
LJ012-0129|learnt through the firm's correspondence that a quantity of gold-dust|English
LJ012-0130|brought in a man-of-war from Brazil had been transhipped at Falmouth for conveyance to London.|English
LJ012-0131|The letter informed him of the marks and sizes of the cases containing the precious metal,|English
LJ012-0132|and he with his father arranged that a messenger should call for the stuff with forged credentials, and anticipating the rightful owner.|English
LJ012-0133|The fraudulent messenger, by the help of young Caspar, established his claim to the boxes, paid the wharfage dues, and carried off the gold-dust.|English
LJ012-0134|Presently the proper person arrived from the consignees, but found the gold-dust gone.|English
LJ012-0135|The police were at once employed, and after infinite pains they discovered the person, one Moss, who had acted as the messenger.|English
LJ012-0136|Moss was known to be intimate with the elder Caspar,|English
LJ012-0137|father of the clerk to the steam-ship company, and these facts were deemed sufficient to justify the arrest of all three.|English
LJ012-0138|They also ascertained that a gold-refiner,|English
LJ012-0139|Solomons, had sold bar gold to the value of one thousand two hundred pounds to certain bullion dealers.|English
LJ012-0140|Solomons was not straightforward in his replies as to where he got the gold, and he was soon placed in the dock with the Caspars and Moss.|English
LJ012-0141|Moss presently turned approver,|English
LJ012-0142|"and implicated ""Money Moses,"" another Jew, for the whole affair had been planned and executed by members of the Hebrew persuasion."|English
LJ012-0143|Money Moses had received the stolen gold-dust from Moss' father-in-law, Davis, or Isaacs, who was never arrested,|English
LJ012-0144|and passed it on to Solomons by his daughter, a widow named Abrahams.|English
LJ012-0145|Solomons was now also admitted as a witness, and his evidence, with that of Moss, secured the transportation of the principal actors in the theft.|English
LJ012-0146|In the course of the trial it came out that almost every one concerned except the Caspars had endeavored to defraud his accomplices.|English
LJ012-0147|Moss peached because he declared he had been done out of the proper price of the gold-dust; but it was clear that he had tried to appropriate the whole of the stuff,|English
LJ012-0148|instead of handing it or the price of it back to the Caspars.|English
LJ012-0149|Money Moses and Mrs. Abrahams imposed upon Moss as to the price paid by Solomons;|English
LJ012-0150|Mrs. Abrahams imposed upon her father by abstracting a portion of the dust and selling it on her own account;|English
LJ012-0151|Solomons cheated the whole lot by retaining half the gold in his possession, and only giving an I. O. U. for it,|English
LJ012-0152|which he refused to redeem on account of the row about the robbery.|English
LJ012-0153|Moses, it may be added, was a direct descendant of Ikey Solomons.|English
LJ012-0154|He was ostensibly a publican,|English
LJ012-0155|and kept the Black Lion in Vinegar Yard, Drury Lane, where secretly he did business as one of the most daring and successful fencers ever known in the metropolis.|English
LJ012-0156|His arrest and conviction cast dismay over the whole gang of receivers, and for a time seriously checked the nefarious traffic.|English
LJ012-0157|"It may be added that prison life did not agree with ""Money Moses""; a striking change came over his appearance while in Newgate."|English
LJ012-0158|Before his confinement he had been a sleek round person, addicted obviously to the pleasures of the table.|English
LJ012-0159|He did not thrive on prison fare,|English
LJ012-0160|now more strictly meager, thanks to the inspectors and the more stringent discipline, and before he embarked for Australia to undergo his fourteen years,|English
LJ012-0161|he was reported to have fallen away to a shadow.|English
LJ012-0162|Having brought down the records of great frauds, forgeries, and thefts from about eighteen twenty-five to eighteen forty,|English
LJ012-0163|I will now retrace my steps and give some account of the more remarkable murders during that period.|English
LJ012-0164|No murder has created greater sensation and horror throughout England than that of Mr. Weare by Thurtell, Hunt, and Probert.|English
LJ012-0165|As this was accomplished beyond the limits of the metropolis, and its perpetrators arraigned at Hertford,|English
LJ012-0166|where the principal actor suffered death, the case hardly comes within the limits of my subject.|English
LJ012-0167|But Probert, who turned king's evidence, and materially assisted conviction,|English
LJ012-0168|was tried at the Old Bailey the following year for horse-stealing, and hanged in front of Newgate.|English
LJ012-0169|The murder was still fresh in the memory of the populace, and Probert was all but lynched on his way to jail.|English
LJ012-0170|According to his statement, when sentenced to death, he had been driven to horse-stealing by the execration which had pursued him after the murder.|English
LJ012-0171|Every door had been closed against him, every hope of future support blasted.|English
LJ012-0172|"Since the calamitous event,"" he went on, ""that happened at Hertford, I have been a lost man."""|English
LJ012-0173|The event which he styles calamitous we may well characterize as one of the most deliberately atrocious murders on record.|English
LJ012-0174|Thurtell was a gambler, and Weare had won a good deal of money from him.|English
LJ012-0175|"Weare was supposed to carry a ""private bank"" about with him in a pocket in his under waistcoat."|English
LJ012-0176|To obtain possession of this, Thurtell with his two associates resolved to kill him.|English
LJ012-0177|The victim was invited to visit Probert's cottage in the country near Elstree.|English
LJ012-0178|"Thurtell drove him down in a gig, ""to be killed as he traveled,"" in Thurtell's own words."|English
LJ012-0179|The others followed, and on overtaking Thurtell, found he had done the job alone in a retired part of the road known as Gill's Hill Lane.|English
LJ012-0180|The murderer explained that he had first fired a pistol at Weare's head, but the shot glanced off his cheek.|English
LJ012-0181|Then he attacked the other's throat with a penknife, and last of all drove the pistol barrel into his forehead.|English
LJ012-0182|After the murder the villains divided the spoil, and went on to Probert's cottage, and supped off pork-chops brought down on purpose.|English
LJ012-0183|During the night they sought to dispose of the body by throwing it into a pond, but two days later had to throw it into another pond.|English
LJ012-0184|Meanwhile the discovery of pistol and knife spattered with human blood and brains|English
LJ012-0185|raised the alarm, and suspicion fell upon the three murderers, who were arrested.|English
LJ012-0186|The crime was brought home to Thurtell by the confession of Hunt,|English
LJ012-0187|one of his accomplices, who took the police to the pond, where the remains of the unfortunate Mr. Weare were discovered, sunk in a sack weighted by stones.|English
LJ012-0188|Probert was then admitted as a witness, and the case was fully proved against Thurtell, who was hanged in front of Hertford Jail.|English
LJ012-0189|Hunt, in consideration of the information he had given, escaped death, and was sentenced to transportation for life.|English
LJ012-0190|Widespread horror and indignation was evoked throughout the kingdom by the discovery of the series|English
LJ012-0191|of atrocious murders perpetrated in Edinburgh by the miscreants Burke and Hare,|English
LJ012-0192|the first of whom has added to the British language a synonym for illegal suppression.|English
LJ012-0193|The crimes of these inhuman purveyors to medical science do not fall within the limits of this work.|English
LJ012-0194|But Burke and Hare had their imitators further south,|English
LJ012-0195|and of these Bishop and Williams, who were guilty of many peculiar atrocities, ended their murderous careers in front of the debtors' door at Newgate.|English
LJ012-0196|Bishop, whose real name was Head, married a half-sister of Williams'. Williams was a professional resurrectionist, or body-snatcher,|English
LJ012-0197|"a trade almost openly countenanced when ""subjects"" for the anatomy schools were only to be got by rifling graves, or worse."|English
LJ012-0198|Bishop was a carpenter, but having been suddenly thrown out of work, he joined his brother-in-law in his line of business.|English
LJ012-0199|After a little|English
LJ012-0200|Bishop got weary of the dangers and fatigues of exhumation, and proposed to Williams that instead of disinterring they should murder their subjects.|English
LJ012-0201|Bishop confessed that he was moved to this by the example of Burke and Hare.|English
LJ012-0202|They pursued their terrible trade for five years without scruple and without detection.|English
LJ012-0203|Eventually the law overtook them, but almost by accident.|English
LJ012-0204|They presented themselves about noon one day at the dissecting room of King's College Hospital, accompanied by a third man,|English
LJ012-0205|"an avowed ""snatcher"" and habitué of the Fortune of War, a public-house in Smithfield frequented openly by men of this awful profession."|English
LJ012-0206|"This man, May, asked the porter at King's College if ""he wanted anything?"" the euphemism for offering a body."|English
LJ012-0207|The porter asked what he had got, and the answer was, a male subject.|English
LJ012-0208|Reference was made to Mr. Partridge, the demonstrator in anatomy,|English
LJ012-0209|and after some haggling they agreed on a price, and in the afternoon the snatchers brought a hamper which contained a body in a sack.|English
LJ012-0210|The porter received it, but from its freshness became suspicious of foul play.|English
LJ012-0211|Mr. Partridge was sent for, and he with some of the students soon decided that the corpse had not died a natural death.|English
LJ012-0212|The snatchers were detained, the police sent for, and arrest followed as a matter of course.|English
LJ012-0213|An inquest was held on the body, which was identified as that of an Italian boy,|English
LJ012-0214|Carlo Ferrari, who made a living by exhibiting white mice about the streets,|English
LJ012-0215|and the jury returned a verdict of willful murder against persons unknown, expressing a strong opinion that Bishop,|English
LJ012-0216|Williams, and May had been concerned in the transaction.|English
LJ012-0217|Meanwhile, a search had been made at Nova Scotia Gardens, Bethnal Green, where Bishop and Williams lived.|English
LJ012-0218|At first nothing peculiar was found; but at a second search the back-garden ground was dug up,|English
LJ012-0219|and in one corner, at some depth, a bundle of clothes were unearthed, which, with a hairy cap,|English
LJ012-0220|were known to be what Ferrari had worn when last seen.|English
LJ012-0221|In another portion of the garden more clothing, partly male and partly female, was discovered,|English
LJ012-0222|plainly pointing to the perpetration of other crimes.|English
LJ012-0223|These facts were represented before the police magistrate|English
LJ012-0224|"who examined Bishop and his fellows, and further incriminating evidence adduced, to the effect that the prisoners had bartered for a coach to carry ""a stiff 'un"";"|English
LJ012-0225|they had also been seen to leave their cottage, carrying out a sack with something heavy inside. On this they were fully committed to Newgate for trial.|English
LJ012-0226|This trial came off in due course at the Central Criminal Court, where the prisoners were charged on two counts,|English
LJ012-0227|one that of the murder of the Italian boy, the other that of a boy unknown.|English
LJ012-0228|The evidence from first to last was circumstantial,|English
LJ012-0229|but the jury, after a short deliberation, did not hesitate to bring in a verdict of guilty, and all three were condemned to death.|English
LJ012-0230|Shortly before the day fixed for execution, Bishop made a full confession, the bulk of which bore the impress of truth,|English
LJ012-0231|although it included statements that were improbable and unsubstantiated.|English
LJ012-0232|He asserted that the victim was a Lincolnshire lad, and not an Italian boy, although the latter was fully proved.|English
LJ012-0233|According to the confession, death had been inflicted by drowning in a well, whereas the medical evidence all pointed to violence.|English
LJ012-0234|It was, however, pretty clear that this victim, like preceding ones, had been lured to Nova Scotia Gardens, and there drugged with a large dose of laudanum.|English
LJ012-0235|While they were in a state of insensibility the murder was committed.|English
LJ012-0236|Bishop's confession was endorsed by Williams, and the immediate result was the respite of May.|English
LJ012-0237|A very painful scene occurred in Newgate when the news of his escape from death was imparted to May.|English
LJ012-0238|He fainted, and the warrant of mercy nearly proved his death-blow. The other two looked on at his agitation with an indifference amounting to apathy.|English
LJ012-0239|The execution took place a week or two later, in the presence of such a crowd as had not been seen near Newgate for years.|English
LJ012-0240|I will close this chapter with a brief account of another murder,|English
LJ012-0241|the memory of which is still fresh in the minds of Londoners, although half a century has passed since it was committed.|English
LJ012-0242|The horror with which Greenacre's crime struck the town was unparalleled since the time when Catherine Hayes slew her husband.|English
LJ012-0243|There were many features of resemblance in these crimes.|English
LJ012-0244|The decapitation and dismemberment, the bestowal of the remains in various parts of the town, the preservation of the head in spirits of wine,|English
LJ012-0245|in the hope that the features might some day be recognized, were alike in both.|English
LJ012-0246|The murder in both cases was long a profound mystery. In this which I am now describing,|English
LJ012-0247|a bricklayer found a human trunk near some new buildings in the Edgeware Road, one morning in the last week of eighteen thirty-six.|English
LJ012-0248|The inquest on these remains, which medical examination showed to be those of a female,|English
LJ012-0249|returned a verdict of willful murder against some person unknown.|English
LJ012-0250|On the seventh July, eighteen thirty-seven,|English
LJ012-0251|"the lockman of ""Ben Jonson lock,"" in Stepney Fields, found a human head jammed into the lock gates."|English
LJ012-0252|Closer investigation proved that it belonged to the trunk already discovered on the second February.|English
LJ012-0253|A further discovery was made in an osier bed near Cold Harbor Lane, Camberwell,|English
LJ012-0254|where a workman found a bundle containing two human legs, in a drain.|English
LJ012-0255|These were the missing members of the same mutilated trunk,|English
LJ012-0256|and there was now evidence sufficient to establish conclusively that the woman thus collected piecemeal had been barbarously done to death.|English
LJ012-0257|But the affair still remained a profound mystery. No light was thrown upon it till, towards the end of March,|English
LJ012-0258|a Mr. Gay of Goodge Street came to view the head, and immediately recognized it as that of a widowed sister, Hannah Brown,|English
LJ012-0259|who had been missing since the previous Christmas Day.|English
LJ012-0260|The murdered individual was thus identified. The next step was to ascertain where and with whom she had last been seen.|English
LJ012-0261|This brought suspicion on to a certain James Greenacre,|English
LJ012-0262|whom she was to have married, and in whose company she had left her own lodgings to visit his in Camberwell.|English
LJ012-0263|The police wished to refer to Greenacre, but as he was not forthcoming,|English
LJ012-0264|a warrant was issued for his apprehension, which was effected at Kennington on the twenty-fourth March.|English
LJ012-0265|A woman named Gale, who lived with him, was arrested at the same time. The prisoners were examined at the Marylebone police court.|English
LJ012-0266|Greenacre, a stout, middle-aged man, wrapped in a brown greatcoat, assumed an air of insolent bravado;|English
LJ012-0267|but his despair must have been great, as was evident from his attempt to strangle himself in the station-house.|English
LJ012-0268|Suspicion grew almost to certainty as the evidence was unfolded.|English
LJ012-0269|Mrs. Brown was a washer-woman, supposed to be worth some money; hence Greenacre's offer of marriage.|English
LJ012-0270|She had realized all her effects, and brought them with her furniture to Greenacre's lodgings. The two when married were to emigrate to Hudson's Bay.|English
LJ012-0271|Whether it was greed or a quarrel that drove Greenacre to the desperate deed remains obscure.|English
LJ012-0272|"They were apparently good friends when last seen together at a neighbor's, where they seemed ""perfectly happy and sociable, and eager for the wedding day."""|English
LJ012-0273|But Greenacre in his confession pretended that he and his intended had quarreled over her property or the want of it,|English
LJ012-0274|and that in a moment of anger he knocked her down.|English
LJ012-0275|He thought he had killed her, and in his terror began at once to consider how he might dispose of the body and escape arrest.|English
LJ012-0276|While she was senseless, but really still alive, he cut off her head, and dismembered the body in the manner already described.|English
LJ012-0277|It is scarcely probable that he would have gone to this extremity if he had had no previous evil intention,|English
LJ012-0278|and the most probable inference is that he inveigled Mrs. Brown to his lodgings with the set purpose of taking her life.|English
LJ012-0279|His measures for the disposal of the corpus delicti remind us of those taken by Mrs. Hayes and her associates,|English
LJ012-0280|or of Gardelle's frantic efforts to conceal his crime.|English
LJ012-0281|The most ghastly part of the story is that which deals with his getting rid of the head.|English
LJ012-0282|This, wrapped up in a silk handkerchief,|English
LJ012-0283|he carried under his coat-flaps through the streets, and afterwards on his cap in a crowded city omnibus.|English
LJ012-0284|It was not until he left the bus, and walked up by the Regent's Canal, that he conceived the idea of throwing the head into the water.|English
LJ012-0285|Another day elapsed before he got rid of the rest of the body,|English
LJ012-0286|all of which, according to his own confession, made no doubt with the idea of exonerating Mrs. Gale, he accomplished without her assistance.|English
LJ012-0287|On the other hand, it was adduced in evidence that Mrs. Gale had been at his lodgings the very day after the murder,|English
LJ012-0288|and was seen to be busily engaged in washing down the house with bucket and mop.|English
LJ012-0289|Greenacre, when tried at the Old Bailey, admitted that he had been guilty of manslaughter.|English
LJ012-0290|While conversing with Mrs. Brown, he declared the unfortunate woman was rocking herself to and fro in a chair;|English
LJ012-0291|as she leant back he put his foot against the chair, and so tilted it over.|English
LJ012-0292|Mrs. Brown fell with it, and Greenacre, to his horror, found that she was dead.|English
LJ012-0293|But the medical evidence was clear that the decapitation had been effected during life, and the jury, after a short deliberation,|English
LJ012-0294|without hesitation brought in a verdict of willful murder.|English
LJ012-0295|The woman Gale was also found guilty, but sentence of death was only passed on Greenacre.|English
LJ012-0296|The execution was, as usual, attended by an immense concourse, and Greenacre died amidst the loudest execrations.|English
LJ013-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section sixteen: Newgate notorieties continued, part one.|English
LJ013-0002|As the century advanced crimes of fraud increased.|English
LJ013-0003|They not only became more numerous, but they were on a wider scale.|English
LJ013-0004|The most extensive and systematic robberies were planned and carried out so as long to escape detection.|English
LJ013-0005|One of the earliest of the big operators in fraudulent finance was Edward Beaumont Smith,|English
LJ013-0006|who was convicted in eighteen forty-one of uttering false exchequer bills to an almost fabulous amount.|English
LJ013-0007|A not entirely novel kind of fraud, but one carried out on a larger scale than heretofore,|English
LJ013-0008|came to light in this same year, eighteen forty-one.|English
LJ013-0009|This was the willful shipwreck and casting away of a vessel which, with her supposed cargo, had been heavily insured.|English
LJ013-0010|The 'Dryad' was a brig owned principally by two persons named Wallace, one a seaman, the other merchant.|English
LJ013-0011|She was freighted by the firm of Zulueta and Co. for a voyage to Santa Cruz.|English
LJ013-0012|Her owners insured her for a full sum of two thousand pounds, after which the Wallaces insured her privily|English
LJ013-0013|with other underwriters for a second sum of two thousand pounds.|English
LJ013-0014|After this, on the faith of forced bills of lading, the captain, Loose by name,|English
LJ013-0015|being a party to the intended fraud, they obtained further insurances on goods never shipped.|English
LJ013-0016|It was fully proved in evidence that when the Dryad sailed she carried nothing but the cargo belonging to Zulueta and Co.|English
LJ013-0017|Yet the Wallaces pretended to have put on board quantities of flannels, cloths, cotton prints,|English
LJ013-0018|beef, pork, butter, and earthenwares, on all of which they effected insurances.|English
LJ013-0019|Loose had his instructions to cast away the ship on the first possible opportunity, and from the time of his leaving Liverpool|English
LJ013-0020|he acted in a manner which excited the suspicions of the crew.|English
LJ013-0021|The larboard pump was suffered to remain choked up, and the long-boat was fitted with tackles and held ready for use at a moment's notice.|English
LJ013-0022|The ship, however, met with exasperatingly fine weather, and it was not until the captain reached the West India Islands|English
LJ013-0023|that he got a chance of accomplishing his crime.|English
LJ013-0024|At a place called the Silver Keys he ran the ship on the reef.|English
LJ013-0025|But another ship, concluding that he was acting in ignorance, rendered him assistance.|English
LJ013-0026|The 'Dryad' was got off, repaired, and her voyage renewed to Santa Cruz.|English
LJ013-0027|He crept along the coast close in shore, looking for a quiet spot to cast away the ship,|English
LJ013-0028|and at last, when within fifteen miles of port, with wind and weather perfectly fair, he ran her on to the rocks.|English
LJ013-0029|Even then she might have been saved, but the captain would not suffer the crew to act. Nearly the whole of the cargo was lost as well as the ship.|English
LJ013-0030|The captain and crew, however, got safely to Jamaica, and so to England; the captain dying on the voyage home.|English
LJ013-0031|The crime soon became public.|English
LJ013-0032|Mate, carpenter, and crew were eager to disavow complicity, and voluntarily gave information.|English
LJ013-0033|The Wallaces were arrested, committed to Newgate, and tried at the Old Bailey.|English
LJ013-0034|The case was clearly proved against them, and both were sentenced to transportation for life.|English
LJ013-0035|While lying in Newgate, awaiting removal to the convict ship, both prisoners made full confessions.|English
LJ013-0036|According to their own statements the loss of the 'Dryad' was only one of six intentional shipwrecks with which they had been concerned.|English
LJ013-0037|The crime of fraudulent insurance they declared was very common, and the underwriters must have lost great sums in this way.|English
LJ013-0038|The merchant Wallace said he had been led into the crime by the advice and example of a city friend who had gone largely into this nefarious business;|English
LJ013-0039|this Wallace added that his friend had made several voyages with the distinct intention of superintending the predetermined shipwrecks.|English
LJ013-0040|The other Wallace, the sailor, also traced his lapse into crime to evil counsel.|English
LJ013-0041|He was an honest sea-captain, he said, trading from Liverpool, where once he had the misfortune to be introduced to a man of wealth,|English
LJ013-0042|the foundations of which had been laid by buying old ships on purpose to cast them away.|English
LJ013-0043|This person made much of Wallace, encouraged his attentions to his daughter,|English
LJ013-0044|and tempted him to take to fraudulent insurance as a certain method of achieving fortune.|English
LJ013-0045|Wallace's relations warned him against his Liverpool friend,|English
LJ013-0046|but he would not take their advice, and developing his transactions, ended as we have seen.|English
LJ013-0047|A clergyman nearly a century later followed in the steps of Dr. Dodd, but did not under more humane laws lose his life.|English
LJ013-0048|The Rev. W. Bailey, LL.D., was convicted at the Central Criminal Court, in February eighteen forty-three, of forgery.|English
LJ013-0049|A notorious miser, Robert Smith, had recently died in Seven Dials, where he had amassed a considerable fortune.|English
LJ013-0050|But among the charges on the estate he left|English
LJ013-0051|was a promissory note for two thousand eight hundred seventy-five pounds, produced by Dr. Bailey, and purporting to be signed by Smith.|English
LJ013-0052|The executors to the estate disputed the validity of this document.|English
LJ013-0053|Miss Bailey, the doctor's sister, in whose favor the note was said to have been given,|English
LJ013-0054|then brought an action against the administrators, and at the trial Dr. Bailey swore that the note had been given him by Smith.|English
LJ013-0055|The jury did not believe him, and the verdict was for the defendants.|English
LJ013-0056|Subsequently Bailey was arrested on a charge of forgery, and after a long trial found guilty. His sentence was transportation for life.|English
LJ013-0057|A gigantic conspiracy to defraud was discovered in the following year, when a solicitor named William Henry Barber,|English
LJ013-0058|Joshua Fletcher a surgeon, and three others were charged with forging wills for the purpose of obtaining unclaimed stock in the funds.|English
LJ013-0059|There were two separate affairs.|English
LJ013-0060|In the first a maiden lady, Miss Slack,|English
LJ013-0061|who was the possessor of two separate sums in consols, neglected through strange carelessness on her own part and that of her friends|English
LJ013-0062|to draw the dividends on more than one sum.|English
LJ013-0063|The other, remaining unclaimed for ten years, was transferred at the end of that time to the commissioners for the reduction of the National Debt.|English
LJ013-0064|Barber, it was said, became aware of this,|English
LJ013-0065|and that he gained access to Miss Slack on pretense of conveying to her some funded property left her by an aunt.|English
LJ013-0066|By this means her signature was obtained; a forged will was prepared bequeathing the unclaimed stock to Miss Slack;|English
LJ013-0067|a note purporting to be from Miss Slack was addressed to the governor of the Bank of England, begging that the said stock might be handed over to her,|English
LJ013-0068|and a person calling herself Miss Slack duly attended at the bank, where the money was handed over to her in proper form.|English
LJ013-0069|A second will, also forged, was propounded at Doctors Commons as that of a Mrs. Hunt of Bristol.|English
LJ013-0070|Mrs. Hunt had left money in the funds which remained unclaimed, and had been transferred, as in Miss Slack's case.|English
LJ013-0071|Here again the money, with ten years' interest, was handed over to Barber and another calling himself Thomas Hunt, an executor of the will.|English
LJ013-0072|It was shown that the will must be a forgery,|English
LJ013-0073|as its signature was dated eighteen twenty-nine, whereas Mrs. Hunt actually died in eighteen oh six.|English
LJ013-0074|A third similar fraud to the amount of two thousand pounds was also brought to light.|English
LJ013-0075|Fletcher was the moving spirit of the whole business. It was he who had introduced Barber to Miss Slack,|English
LJ013-0076|and held all the threads of these intricate and nefarious transactions.|English
LJ013-0077|Barber and Fletcher were both transported for life, although Fletcher declared that Barber was innocent, and had no guilty knowledge of what was being done.|English
LJ013-0078|Barber was subsequently pardoned, but was not replaced on the rolls as an attorney till eighteen fifty-five,|English
LJ013-0079|when Lord Campbell delivered judgment on Barber's petition, to the effect that|English
LJ013-0080|the evidence to establish his (Barber's) connivance in the frauds was too doubtful for us to continue his exclusion any longer.|English
LJ013-0081|Banks and bankers continued to be victimized.|English
LJ013-0082|In eighteen forty-four|English
LJ013-0083|the Bank of England was defrauded of a sum of eight thousand pounds by one of its clerks, Burgess, in conjunction with an accomplice named Elder.|English
LJ013-0084|Burgess fraudulently transferred consols to the above amount, standing in the name of Mr. Oxenford, to another party.|English
LJ013-0085|A person, Elder of course, who personated Oxenford, attended at the bank to complete the transfer and sell the stock.|English
LJ013-0086|Burgess, who was purposely on leave from the bank, effected the sale, which was paid for with a cheque for nearly the whole amount on Lubbock's Bank.|English
LJ013-0087|Burgess and Elder proceeded in company to cash this, but as they wanted all gold,|English
LJ013-0088|the cashier gave them eight Bank of England notes for one thousand pounds each, saying that they could get so much specie nowhere else.|English
LJ013-0089|Thither Elder went alone, provided with a number of canvas and one large carpet-bag.|English
LJ013-0090|But when the latter was filled with gold it was too heavy to lift,|English
LJ013-0091|and Elder had to be assisted by two bank porters, who carried it for him to a carriage waiting near the Mansion House.|English
LJ013-0092|The thieves, for Elder was soon joined by Burgess, drove together to Ben Caunt's, the pugilist's, public-house in St. Martin's Lane,|English
LJ013-0093|where the cash was transferred from the carpet-bag to a portmanteau.|English
LJ013-0094|The same evening both started for Liverpool, and embarking on board the mail steamer 'Britannia,' escaped to the United States.|English
LJ013-0095|Burgess' continued absence was soon noticed at the bank.|English
LJ013-0096|Suspicions were aroused when it was found that he had been employed in selling stock for Mr. Oxenford, which developed into certainty|English
LJ013-0097|as soon as that gentleman was referred to.|English
LJ013-0098|Mr. Oxenford having denied that he had made any transfer of stock, the matter was at once put into the hands of the police.|English
LJ013-0099|A smart detective, Forrester, after a little inquiry,|English
LJ013-0100|established the fact that the man who had personated Mr. Oxenford was a horse-dealer named Joseph Elder, an intimate acquaintance of Burgess'.|English
LJ013-0101|Forrester next traced the fugitives to Liverpool,|English
LJ013-0102|and thence to Halifax, whither he followed them, accompanied by a confidential clerk from the bank.|English
LJ013-0103|At Halifax Forrester learnt that the men he wanted had gone on to Boston, thence to Buffalo and Canada, and back to Boston.|English
LJ013-0104|He found them at length residing at the latter place, one as a landed proprietor, the other as a publican.|English
LJ013-0105|Elder, the former, was soon apprehended at his house, but he evaded the law by hanging himself with his pocket-handkerchief.|English
LJ013-0106|The inn belonging to Burgess was surrounded|English
LJ013-0107|but he escaped through a back door on to the river, and rowed off in a boat to a hiding-place in the woods.|English
LJ013-0108|Next day a person betrayed him for the reward, and he was soon captured.|English
LJ013-0109|The proceeds of the robbery were lodged in a Boston bank,|English
LJ013-0110|but four hundred sovereigns were found on Elder, while two hundred more were found in Burgess' effects.|English
LJ013-0111|Burgess was eventually brought back to England, tried at the Central Criminal Court, and sentenced to transportation for life.|English
LJ013-0112|Within a month or two the bank of Messrs. Rogers and Co., Clement's Lane, was broken into.|English
LJ013-0113|Robberies as daring in conception as they were boldly executed were common enough.|English
LJ013-0114|One night a quantity of plate was stolen from Windsor Castle; another time Buckingham Palace was robbed.|English
LJ013-0115|Of this class was the ingenious yet peculiarly simple robbery effected at the house of Lord Fitzgerald in Belgrave Square.|English
LJ013-0116|The butler, on the occasion of a death in the family, when the house was in some confusion, arranged with a burglar to come in,|English
LJ013-0117|and with another carry off the plate-chest in broad daylight, and as a matter of business. No one interfered or asked any questions.|English
LJ013-0118|The thief walked into the house in Belgrave Square, and openly carried off the plate-chest, deposited it in a light cart at the door, and drove away.|English
LJ013-0119|Howse, the steward, accused the other servants, but they retorted, declaring that he had been visited by the thief the day previous,|English
LJ013-0120|whom he had shown over the plate closet.|English
LJ013-0121|Howse and his accomplice were arrested; the former was found guilty and sentenced to fifteen years, but the latter was acquitted.|English
LJ013-0122|Stealing plate was about this period the crime of a more aristocratic thief.|English
LJ013-0123|The club spoons and other articles of plate were long a source of profitable income to a gentleman named Ashley,|English
LJ013-0124|who belonged to five good London clubs --|English
LJ013-0125|the Junior United Service, the Union, Reform, Colonial, and Erechtheum clubs.|English
LJ013-0126|When one of these clubs was taken in at the Army and Navy, that establishment also suffered.|English
LJ013-0127|Suspicion fell at length upon Ashley, who was seen to handle the forks and spoons at table in a strange manner.|English
LJ013-0128|A watch was set on his house, in Allington Street, Pimlico,|English
LJ013-0129|and one day a police constable tracked him to a silversmith's in Holborn Hill,|English
LJ013-0130|where Ashley produced four silver spoons, and begged that his initials might be engraved upon them.|English
LJ013-0131|Ashley was arrested as he left the shop; the spoons were impounded, and it was found that the club monogram had been erased from them.|English
LJ013-0132|On a search of the prisoner's lodgings in Allington Street, a silver fork was found,|English
LJ013-0133|a number of pawnbrokers' duplicates, and three small files. It was proved at the trial that Ashley had asked his landlady for brick-dust and leather,|English
LJ013-0134|and it was contended that these with the files were used to alter the marks on the plate.|English
LJ013-0135|At most of the clubs the servants had been mulcted to make good lost plate, which had no doubt been stolen by the prisoner.|English
LJ013-0136|Several pawnbrokers were subpoenaed and obliged to surrender plate, to the extent in some cases of a couple of dozen of spoons or forks,|English
LJ013-0137|which the various club secretaries identified as the property of their respective clubs.|English
LJ013-0138|Ashley was the son of an army agent and banker,|English
LJ013-0139|and many witnesses were brought to attest to his previous good character, but he was found guilty and sentenced to seven years' transportation.|English
LJ013-0140|A robbery of a somewhat novel kind was executed in rather a bungling fashion by Ker, a sea-captain,|English
LJ013-0141|whose ship brought home a mixed cargo from Bahia and other ports.|English
LJ013-0142|Part of the freight were four hundred rough diamonds valued at four thousand pounds.|English
LJ013-0143|These packages were consigned to Messrs. Shroeder of London; and as it was known that they were to arrive in Ker's ship,|English
LJ013-0144|one of the owners had met her at Deal, but the captain had already absconded with the packages of precious stones in his pocket.|English
LJ013-0145|Ker came at once to London, and, by the help of the landlord of a public-house in Smithfield and others, disposed of the whole of the diamonds.|English
LJ013-0146|A Jew named Benjamin effected the sale to certain merchants named Blogg and Martin,|English
LJ013-0147|who declared that the rough diamond market was in such a depressed condition that they could only afford to give one thousand seven fifty pounds for stones worth|English
LJ013-0148|four thousand pounds|English
LJ013-0149|The circumstances of this purchase of brilliants from a stranger at such an inadequate price was strongly commented upon at Ker's trial.|English
LJ013-0150|The moment it was discovered that the diamonds had disappeared, the affair was taken up by the police.|English
LJ013-0151|Forrester, the detective who had pursued and captured Burgess at Boston, tracked Ker to France, and following him there, eventually captured him|English
LJ013-0152|at Montreuil. He was arraigned at the Old Bailey, and the case fully proved. His sentence was seven years' transportation.|English
LJ013-0153|The gravest crimes continued at intervals to inspire the town with horror, and concentrate public attention upon the jail of Newgate,|English
LJ013-0154|and the murderers immured within its walls.|English
LJ013-0155|Courvoisier's case made a great stir. There was unusual atrocity in this murder of an aged, infirm gentleman,|English
LJ013-0156|a scion of the ducal house of Bedford, by his confidential valet and personal attendant.|English
LJ013-0157|Lord William Russell lived alone in Norfolk Street, Park Lane. He was a widower, and seventy-three years of age.|English
LJ013-0158|One morning in May his lordship was found dead in his bed with his throat cut.|English
LJ013-0159|The fact of the murder was first discovered by the housemaid,|English
LJ013-0160|who, on going down early, was surprised to find the dining-room in a state of utter confusion;|English
LJ013-0161|the furniture turned upside down, the drawers of the escritoire open and rifled,|English
LJ013-0162|a bundle lying on the floor, as though thieves had been interrupted in the act.|English
LJ013-0163|The housemaid summoned the cook, and both went to call the valet, Courvoisier,|English
LJ013-0164|who came from his room ready dressed, a suspicious circumstance, as he was always late in the morning.|English
LJ013-0165|The housemaid suggested that they should see if his lordship was all right, and the three went to his bedroom.|English
LJ013-0166|While Courvoisier opened the shutters, the housemaid, approaching the bed, saw that the pillow was saturated with blood.|English
LJ013-0167|The discovery of the murdered man immediately followed. The neighborhood was alarmed, the police sent for, and a close inquiry forthwith commenced.|English
LJ013-0168|That Lord William Russell had committed suicide was at once declared impossible.|English
LJ013-0169|It was also clearly proved that no forcible entry had been made into the house;|English
LJ013-0170|the fresh marks of violence upon the door had evidently been made inside, and not from outside;|English
LJ013-0171|moreover, the instruments, poker and chisel, by which they had no doubt been effected,|English
LJ013-0172|were found in the butler's pantry, used by Courvoisier.|English
LJ013-0173|The researches of the police soon laid bare other suspicious facts.|English
LJ013-0174|The bundle found in the dining-room contained, with clothes, various small articles of plate and jewelery which a thief would probably have put into his pocket.|English
LJ013-0175|Upstairs in the bedroom a rouleaux box for sovereigns had been broken open,|English
LJ013-0176|also the jewel-box and note-case, from the latter of which was abstracted a ten-pound note known to have been in the possession of the deceased.|English
LJ013-0177|His lordship's watch was gone.|English
LJ013-0178|Further suspicion was caused by the position of a book and a wax candle by the bedside.|English
LJ013-0179|The latter was so placed that it could throw no light on the former, which was a 'Life of Sir Samuel Romilly.'|English
LJ013-0180|The intention of the real murderer to shift the crime to burglars was evident although futile,|English
LJ013-0181|and the police, feeling convinced that the crime had been committed by some inmate of the house,|English
LJ013-0182|took Courvoisier into custody, and placed the two female servants under surveillance.|English
LJ013-0183|The valet's strange demeanor had attracted attention from the first.|English
LJ013-0184|He had hung over the body in a state of dreadful agitation, answering no questions, and taking no part in the proceedings.|English
LJ013-0185|Three days later a close search of the butler's pantry produced fresh circumstantial evidence.|English
LJ013-0186|Behind the skirting board several of his lordship's rings were discovered;|English
LJ013-0187|near it was his Waterloo medal, and the above-mentioned ten-pound note.|English
LJ013-0188|Further investigation was rewarded by the discovery in the pantry of a split gold ring, used by Lord William to carry his keys on;|English
LJ013-0189|next, and in the same place, a chased gold key;|English
LJ013-0190|and at last his lordship's watch was found secreted under the leads of the sink.|English
LJ013-0191|All this was evidence sufficient to warrant Courvoisier's committal for trial;|English
LJ013-0192|but still he found friends, and a liberal subscription was raised among the foreign servants in London to provide funds for his defense.|English
LJ013-0193|Courvoisier, when put on his trial, pleaded not guilty;|English
LJ013-0194|but on the second day the discovery of fresh evidence, more particularly the recovery of some of Lord William's stolen plate,|English
LJ013-0195|induced the prisoner to make a full confession of his crime to the lawyers who defended him.|English
LJ013-0196|This placed them in a position of much embarrassment. To have thrown up their brief would have been to have secured Courvoisier's conviction.|English
LJ013-0197|Mr. Phillips, who led in the case, went to the other extreme,|English
LJ013-0198|and in an impassioned address implored the jury not to send an innocent man to the gallows.|English
LJ013-0199|It will be remembered that the question whether Mr. Phillips had not exceeded the limits usually allowed to counsel was much debated at the time.|English
LJ013-0200|The jury without hesitation found Courvoisier guilty, and he was sentenced to death.|English
LJ013-0201|The prisoner's demeanor had greatly changed during the trial.|English
LJ013-0202|Coolness amounting almost to effrontery gave way to hopeless dejection.|English
LJ013-0203|On his removal to Newgate after sentence,|English
LJ013-0204|he admitted that he had been justly convicted, and expressed great anxiety that his fellow-servants should be relieved from all suspicion.|English
LJ013-0205|Later in the day he tried to commit suicide by cramming a towel down his throat, but was prevented.|English
LJ013-0206|Next morning he made a full confession in presence of his attorney, and the governor, Mr. Cope.|English
LJ013-0207|In this he gave as the motives of his crime a quarrel he had with his master, who threatened to discharge him without a character.|English
LJ013-0208|Lord William, according to the valet, was of a peevish, difficult temper;|English
LJ013-0209|he was annoyed with his man for various small omissions and acts of forgetfulness, and on the night of the murder had taken Courvoisier to task rather sharply.|English
LJ013-0210|Finally, on coming downstairs after bed-time, Lord William had found Courvoisier in the dining-room.|English
LJ013-0211|What are you doing here? asked his lordship.|English
LJ013-0212|You can have no good intentions; you must quit my service tomorrow morning.|English
LJ013-0213|This seems to have decided Courvoisier,|English
LJ013-0214|who took a carving-knife from the sideboard in the dining-room, went upstairs to Lord William's bedroom, and drew the knife across his throat.|English
LJ013-0215|He appeared to die instantly, said the murderer, in conclusion.|English
LJ013-0216|His account of his acts and movements after the deed|English
LJ013-0217|varied so considerably in the several documents he left behind, that too much reliance cannot be placed upon his confession.|English
LJ013-0218|"His last statement contains the words, ""The public now think I am a liar, and they will not believe me when I say the truth."""|English
LJ013-0219|This was no doubt the case, but this much truth his confession may be taken to contain:|English
LJ013-0220|that Courvoisier was idle, discontented, ready to take offense, greedy of gain;|English
LJ013-0221|that he could not resist the opportunity for robbery offered him by his situation at Lord William Russell's; that when vexed with his master|English
LJ013-0222|he did not shrink from murder, both for revenge and to conceal his other crimes.|English
LJ013-0223|Courvoisier wished to commit suicide in Newgate, but was prevented by the vigilant supervision to which he was subjected while in jail.|English
LJ013-0224|The attempt was to have been made by opening a vein and allowing himself to bleed to death.|English
LJ013-0225|The Sunday night before his execution he would not go to bed when ordered.|English
LJ013-0226|The governor insisted, but Courvoisier showed great reluctance to strip.|English
LJ013-0227|The order was, however, at length obeyed, and the whole of the prisoner's clothes were minutely searched.|English
LJ013-0228|In the pocket of the coat Mr. Cope, the governor, found a neatly-folded cloth, and asked what it was for.|English
LJ013-0229|Courvoisier admitted that he had intended to bind it tightly round his arm and bleed himself to death in the night.|English
LJ013-0230|"The next inquiry was how he hoped to open a vein. ""With a bit of sharpened stick picked out of the ordinary firewood."""|English
LJ013-0231|Where is it? asked the governor.|English
LJ013-0232|The prisoner replied that he had left it in the mattress of which he had just been deprived.|English
LJ013-0233|The bed was searched, but no piece of sharpened wood was found. It was thought that it might have been lost in changing the mattresses.|English
LJ013-0234|The cloth above referred to belonged to the inner seam of his trousers, which he had managed to tear out.|English
LJ013-0235|There is nothing to show that Courvoisier really contemplated self-destruction.|English
LJ013-0236|A murder which reproduced many of the features of that committed by Greenacre soon followed, and excited the public mind even more than that of Courvoisier's.|English
LJ013-0237|Daniel Good's crime might have remained long undiscovered but for his own careless stupidity.|English
LJ013-0238|He was coachman to a gentleman at Roehampton. One day he went into a pawnbroker's at Wandsworth, and bought a pair of breeches on credit.|English
LJ013-0239|At the same time he was seen to steal and secrete a pair of trousers. The shop-boy gave information.|English
LJ013-0240|Good was followed to his stables by a policeman, but obstinately denied the theft.|English
LJ013-0241|The policeman insisted on searching the premises, at which Good displayed some uneasiness.|English
LJ013-0242|This increased when the officer, accompanied by two others, a neighbor and a bailiff, entered one of the stables.|English
LJ013-0243|Good now offered to go to Wandsworth and satisfy the pawnbroker.|English
LJ013-0244|Just at this moment, however, the searchers found concealed under two trusses of hay a woman's headless and dismembered trunk.|English
LJ013-0245|At the constable's cry of alarm Good rushed from the stable and locked the door behind him.|English
LJ013-0246|Some time elapsed before the imprisoned party could force open the doors, and by then the fugitive had escaped.|English
LJ013-0247|Medical assistance having been summoned, it was ascertained how the dismemberment had been effected.|English
LJ013-0248|At the same time an overpowering odor attracted them to the adjoining harness-room, where the missing remains were raked out|English
LJ013-0249|half consumed in the ashes of a wood fire.|English
LJ013-0250|In the same room a large axe and saw were found covered with blood.|English
LJ013-0251|"Inquiry into the character of Good exposed him as a loose liver, who ""kept company"" with several women."|English
LJ013-0252|One called his sister, but supposed to be his wife, had occupied a room in South Street, Manchester Square,|English
LJ013-0253|with a son of Good's by a former wife. Another wife, real or fictitious, existed in Spitalfields,|English
LJ013-0254|and evidence was given of close relation between Good and a third woman, a girl named Butcher, residing at Woolwich.|English
LJ013-0255|The victim was the first of these three.|English
LJ013-0256|Good had told her, much to her perturbation, that she was to move from South Street to Roehampton, and one day he fetched her.|English
LJ013-0257|They were seen together on Barnes Common, and again in Putney Park Lane, where they were talking loud and angrily.|English
LJ013-0258|The poor creature was never seen again alive.|English
LJ013-0259|The actual method of the murder was never exactly ascertained.|English
LJ013-0260|Good himself remained at large for some weeks. He had tramped as far as Tunbridge, where he obtained work as a bricklayer's laborer;|English
LJ013-0261|he there gave satisfaction for industry, but he was taciturn, and would hold no converse with his fellows.|English
LJ013-0262|The woman where he lodged noticed that he was very restless at night, moaning and sighing much. Detection came unexpectedly.|English
LJ013-0263|He was recognized by an ex-policeman who had known him at Roehampton, and immediately arrested.|English
LJ013-0264|In his effects were found the clothes he had on at the time of his escape from the stables, and under the jacket he was wearing|English
LJ013-0265|was a piece of a woman's calico apron stained with blood, which he had used to save the pressure on his shoulder by the hod.|English
LJ013-0266|Good was committed to Newgate, and tried at the Central Criminal Court before a crowded court.|English
LJ013-0267|He made a rambling defense, ending by saying,|English
LJ013-0268|Good ladies and gentlemen all, I have a great deal more to say, but I am so bad I cannot say it.|English
LJ014-0001|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section seventeen: Newgate notorieties continued, part two.|English
LJ014-0002|Hocker's murder is in its way interesting, as affording another proof of the extraordinary way in which the culprit returned to the scene of his guilt.|English
LJ014-0003|The cries of his victim, a Mr. Delarue,|English
LJ014-0004|brought passers-by and policemen to the spot, a lonely place near a dead wall beyond Belsize Hall, Hampstead,|English
LJ014-0005|but too late to give substantial aid.|English
LJ014-0006|While the body lay there still warm, battered and bleeding from the cruel blows inflicted upon him by his cowardly assailant, a man came by singing.|English
LJ014-0007|He entered into conversation with the policemen, and learnt, as it seemed for the first time, what had happened.|English
LJ014-0008|"His remark was, ""It is a nasty job;"" he took hold of the dead hand, and confessed that he felt ""queer"" at the shocking sight."|English
LJ014-0009|This sight was his own handiwork,|English
LJ014-0010|yet he could not overcome the strange fascination it had for him, and remained by the side of the corpse till the stretcher came.|English
LJ014-0011|Even then he followed it as far as Belsize Lane.|English
LJ014-0012|It was here that the others engaged in their dismal office in removing the dead first got a good look at the stranger's face.|English
LJ014-0013|He wanted a light for a cigar, and got it from a lantern which was lifted up and fully betrayed his features.|English
LJ014-0014|It was noticed that he wore a mackintosh. Next day the police, in making a careful search of the scene of the murder,|English
LJ014-0015|picked up a coat-button, which afterwards played an important part in the identification of the murderer.|English
LJ014-0016|A letter, which afforded an additional clue, was also found in the pocket of the deceased. Still it was many weeks before any arrest was made.|English
LJ014-0017|In the mean time the police were not idle.|English
LJ014-0018|It came out by degrees that the person who had been seen in Belsize Lane on the night the body was found was a friend of the deceased.|English
LJ014-0019|His name was Hocker; he was by trade a ladies' shoemaker; and it was also ascertained that after the day of the murder he was flush of money.|English
LJ014-0020|He was soon afterwards arrested on suspicion, and a search of his lodgings brought to light several garments saturated with blood;|English
LJ014-0021|a coat among them much torn and stained, with three buttons missing, one of which corresponded with that picked up at Hampstead.|English
LJ014-0022|The letter found in the pocket of the deceased was sealed with a wafer marked F,|English
LJ014-0023|and many of the same sort were found in the possession of the accused. This was enough to obtain a committal,|English
LJ014-0024|after several remands; but the case contained elements of doubt, and the evidence at the trial was entirely circumstantial.|English
LJ014-0025|A witness deposed to meeting Hocker, soon after the cries of murder were heard,|English
LJ014-0026|running at a dog-trot into London, and others swore that they plainly recognized him as the man seen soon afterwards in the lane.|English
LJ014-0027|A woman whom he called on the same evening declared he had worn a mackintosh, his coat was much torn, there was a stain of blood on his shirt-cuff,|English
LJ014-0028|and he was in possession, the first time to her knowledge, of a watch.|English
LJ014-0029|This was Delarue's watch, fully identified as such, which Hocker told his brother Delarue had given him the morning of the murder.|English
LJ014-0030|These were damnatory facts which well supported the prosecution.|English
LJ014-0031|The prisoner made an elaborate defense, in which he sought to vilify the character of deceased|English
LJ014-0032|as the seducer of an innocent girl to whom he (Hocker) had been fondly attached.|English
LJ014-0033|When her ruin was discovered her brother panted for revenge.|English
LJ014-0034|Hocker, whose skill in counterfeiting handwriting was known, was asked to fabricate a letter making an assignation with Delarue|English
LJ014-0035|in a lonely part of Hampstead.|English
LJ014-0036|Hocker and the brother went to the spot, where the latter left him to meet his sister's seducer alone.|English
LJ014-0037|"Soon afterwards Hocker heard cries of ""murder,"""|English
LJ014-0038|and proceeding to where they came from, found Delarue dead, slain by the furious brother.|English
LJ014-0039|Hocker was so overcome, feeling himself the principal cause of the tragedy,|English
LJ014-0040|that he rushed to a slaughterhouse in Hampstead and purposely stained his clothes with blood.|English
LJ014-0041|Such an extravagant defense did not weigh with judge or jury;|English
LJ014-0042|the first summed up dead against the prisoner, and the latter, after retiring for ten minutes, found him guilty.|English
LJ014-0043|Hocker's conduct in Newgate while under sentence of death was most extraordinary.|English
LJ014-0044|He drew up several long statements, containing narratives purely fictitious, imputing crimes to his victim, and repeating his line of defense|English
LJ014-0045|that Delarue had suffered by the hands of imaginary outraged brothers acting as the avengers of females deeply injured by him.|English
LJ014-0046|Hocker made several pretended confessions and revelations, all of which were proved to be absolutely false by the police on inquiry.|English
LJ014-0047|His demeanor was a strange compound of wickedness, falsehood, and deceit.|English
LJ014-0048|But at the fatal hour his hardihood forsook him, and he was almost insensible when taken out of his cell for execution.|English
LJ014-0049|Restoratives were applied, but he was in a fainting condition when tied, and had to be supported by the assistant executioner|English
LJ014-0050|while Calcraft adjusted the noose.|English
LJ014-0051|There was an epidemic of murder in the United Kingdom about eighteen forty-eight to nine.|English
LJ014-0052|In November of the first-named year occurred the wholesale slaughter of the Jermys in their house, Stanfield Hall, by the miscreant Rush.|English
LJ014-0053|Soon afterwards, in Gloucestershire,|English
LJ014-0054|a maidservant, Sarah Thomas, murdered her mistress, an aged woman, by beating out her brains with a stone.|English
LJ014-0055|Next year John Gleeson Wilson, at Liverpool, murdered a woman, Ann Henrichson, also a maidservant and two children;|English
LJ014-0056|while in Ireland a wife dashed out her husband's brains with a hammer.|English
LJ014-0057|London did not escape the contagion, and prominent among the detestable crimes of the period stands that of the Mannings at Bermondsey.|English
LJ014-0058|These great criminals suffered at Horsemonger Lane Jail, but they were tried at the Central Criminal Court, and were for some time inmates of Newgate.|English
LJ014-0059|Their victim was a man named Patrick O'Connor, a Custom-House gauger, who had been a suitor of Marie de Roux before she became Mrs. Manning.|English
LJ014-0060|Marie de Roux up to the time of her marriage had been in service as lady's maid to Lady Blantyre, daughter of the Duchess of Sutherland,|English
LJ014-0061|and Manning hoped to get some small Government appointment through his wife's interest.|English
LJ014-0062|He had failed in this as well as in the business of a publican, which he had at one time adopted.|English
LJ014-0063|After the marriage a close intimacy was still maintained between O'Connor and the Mannings.|English
LJ014-0064|He lived at Mile End, whence he walked often to call at three, Minver Place, Bermondsey, the residence of his old love.|English
LJ014-0065|O'Connor was a man of substance. He had long followed the profitable trade of a money-lender,|English
LJ014-0066|and by dint of usurious interest on small sums advanced to needy neighbors, had amassed as much as eight thousand pounds or ten thousand pounds.|English
LJ014-0067|"His wealth was well known to ""Maria,"" as he called Mrs. Manning, who made several ineffectual attempts to get money out of him."|English
LJ014-0068|At last this fiendish woman made up her mind to murder O'Connor and appropriate all his possessions.|English
LJ014-0069|Her husband, to whom she coolly confided her intention,|English
LJ014-0070|a heavy brutish fellow, was yet aghast at his wife's resolve, and tried hard to dissuade her from bad purpose.|English
LJ014-0071|In his confession after sentence he declared that she plied him well with brandy at this period,|English
LJ014-0072|and that during the whole time he was never in his right senses.|English
LJ014-0073|Meanwhile this woman, unflinching in her cold, bloody determination, carefully laid all her plans for the consummation of the deed.|English
LJ014-0074|One fine afternoon in August, O'Connor was met walking in the direction of Bermondsey.|English
LJ014-0075|He was dressed with particular care, as he was to dine at the Mannings and meet friends, one a young lady.|English
LJ014-0076|He was seen afterwards smoking and talking with his hosts in their back parlor, and never seen again alive.|English
LJ014-0077|It came out in the husband's confession that Mrs. Manning induced O'Connor to go down to the kitchen to wash his hands, that she followed him to the basement,|English
LJ014-0078|that she stood behind him as he stood near the open grave she herself had dug for him,|English
LJ014-0079|and which he mistook for a drain, and that while he was speaking to her she put the muzzle of a pistol close to the back of his head and shot him down.|English
LJ014-0080|She ran upstairs, told her husband, made him go down to look at her handiwork, and as O'Connor was not quite dead,|English
LJ014-0081|Manning gave the coup de grace with a crowbar.|English
LJ014-0082|After this Mrs. Manning changed her dress and went off in a cab to O'Connor's lodgings,|English
LJ014-0083|which, having possessed herself of the murdered man's keys, she rifled from end to end.|English
LJ014-0084|Returning to her own home, where Manning meantime had been calmly smoking and talking to the neighbors over the basement wall,|English
LJ014-0085|the corpse lying just inside the kitchen all the while, the two set to work to strip the body and hide it under the stones of the floor.|English
LJ014-0086|This job was not completed till the following day, as the hole had to be enlarged, and the only tool they had was a dust-shovel.|English
LJ014-0087|A quantity of quicklime was thrown in with the body to destroy all identification.|English
LJ014-0088|This was on a Thursday evening.|English
LJ014-0089|For the remainder of that week and part of the next the murderers stayed in the house, and occupied the kitchen, close to the remains of their victim.|English
LJ014-0090|On the Sunday Mrs. Manning roasted a goose at this same kitchen fire, and ate it with relish in the afternoon.|English
LJ014-0091|This cold-blooded indifference after the event was only outdone by the premeditation of this horrible murder.|English
LJ014-0092|The hole must have been excavated and the quicklime purchased quite three weeks before O'Connor met his death,|English
LJ014-0093|and during that time he must frequently have stood or sat over his own grave.|English
LJ014-0094|Discovery of the murder came in this wise. O'Connor, a punctual and well-conducted official, was at once missed at the London Docks.|English
LJ014-0095|On the third day his friends began to inquire for him,|English
LJ014-0096|and at their request two police officers were sent to Bermondsey to inquire for him at the Mannings, with whom it was well known that he was very intimate.|English
LJ014-0097|The Mannings had seen or heard nothing of him, of course. As O'Connor still did not turn up, the police after a couple of days returned to Minver Place.|English
LJ014-0098|The house was empty, bare and stripped of all its furniture, and its former occupants had decamped.|English
LJ014-0099|The circumstance was suspicious, and a search was at once made of the whole premises.|English
LJ014-0100|In the back kitchen one of the detectives remarked that the cement between certain stones looked lighter than the rest, and on trying it with a knife,|English
LJ014-0101|he found that it was soft and new, while elsewhere it was set and hard.|English
LJ014-0102|The stones were at once taken up;|English
LJ014-0103|beneath them was a layer of fresh mortar, beneath that a lot of loose earth, amongst which a stocking was turned up, and presently a human toe.|English
LJ014-0104|Six inches lower the body of O'Connor was uncovered.|English
LJ014-0105|He was lying on his face, his legs tied up to his hips so as to allow of the body fitting into the hole.|English
LJ014-0106|The lime had done its work so rapidly that the features would have been indistinguishable but for the prominent chin and a set of false teeth.|English
LJ014-0107|The corpse settled all doubts, and the next point was to lay hands upon the Mannings.|English
LJ014-0108|It was soon ascertained that the wife had gone off in a cab with a quantity of luggage.|English
LJ014-0109|Part of this she had deposited to be left till called for at one station, while she had gone herself to another, that at Euston Square.|English
LJ014-0110|At the first the boxes were impounded, opened, and found to contain many of O'Connor's effects.|English
LJ014-0111|At the second exact information was obtained of Mrs. Manning's movements. She had gone to Edinburgh.|English
LJ014-0112|A telegraphic message, then newly adapted to the purposes of criminal detection,|English
LJ014-0113|advised the Edinburgh police of the whole affair, and within an hour an answer was telegraphed, stating that Mrs. Manning was in custody.|English
LJ014-0114|She had been to brokers to negotiate the sale of certain foreign railway stock, with which they had been warned from London not to deal,|English
LJ014-0115|and they had given information to the police.|English
LJ014-0116|Her arrest was planned, and, when the telegram arrived from London, completed.|English
LJ014-0117|An examination of her boxes disclosed a quantity of O'Connor's property.|English
LJ014-0118|Mrs. Manning was transferred to London and lodged in the Horsemonger Lane Jail, where her husband soon afterwards joined her.|English
LJ014-0119|He had fled to Jersey, where he was recognized and arrested.|English
LJ014-0120|Each tried to throw the blame on the other; Manning declared his wife had committed the murder, Mrs. Manning indignantly denied the charge.|English
LJ014-0121|The prisoners were in due course transferred to Newgate, to be put upon their trial at the Central Criminal Court.|English
LJ014-0122|A great number of distinguished people assembled as usual at the Old Bailey on the day of trial.|English
LJ014-0123|The Mannings were arraigned together; the husband standing at one of the front corners of the dock, his wife at the other end.|English
LJ014-0124|Manning, who was dressed in black, appeared to be a heavy, bull-necked, repulsive-looking man, with a very fair complexion and light hair.|English
LJ014-0125|Mrs. Manning was not without personal charms;|English
LJ014-0126|her face was comely, she had dark hair and good eyes, and was above the middle height, yet inclined to be stout.|English
LJ014-0127|She was smartly dressed in a plaid shawl, a white lace cap;|English
LJ014-0128|her hair was dressed in long crepe bands. She had lace ruffles at her wrist, and wore primrose-colored kid gloves.|English
LJ014-0129|The case rested upon the facts which have been already set forth, and was proved to the satisfaction of the jury, who brought in a verdict of guilty.|English
LJ014-0130|Manning, when sentence of death was passed on him, said nothing;|English
LJ014-0131|but Mrs. Manning, speaking in a foreign accent, addressed the court with great fluency and vehemence.|English
LJ014-0132|She complained that she had no justice; there was no law for her, she had found no protection either from judges, the prosecutor, or her husband.|English
LJ014-0133|She had not been treated like a Christian, but like a wild beast of the forest. She declared that the money found in her possession had been sent her from abroad;|English
LJ014-0134|that O'Connor had been more to her than her husband, that she ought to have married him.|English
LJ014-0135|It was against common sense to charge her with murdering the only friend she had in the world;|English
LJ014-0136|the culprit was really her husband, who killed O'Connor out of jealousy and revengeful feelings.|English
LJ014-0137|When the judge assumed the black cap|English
LJ014-0138|"Mrs. Manning became still more violent, shouting, ""No, no, I will not stand it! You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!"""|English
LJ014-0139|and would have left the dock had not Mr. Cope, the governor of Newgate, restrained her.|English
LJ014-0140|After judgment was passed she repeatedly cried out Shame!|English
LJ014-0141|and stretching out her hand, she gathered up a quantity of the rue which, following ancient custom dating from the days of the jail fever,|English
LJ014-0142|was strewn in front of the dock, and sprinkled it towards the bench with a contemptuous gesture.|English
LJ014-0143|On being removed to Newgate from the court Mrs. Manning became perfectly furious.|English
LJ014-0144|She uttered loud imprecations, cursing judge, jury, barristers, witnesses, and all who stood around.|English
LJ014-0146|They had to handcuff her by force against the most violent resistance, and still she raged and stormed,|English
LJ014-0147|shaking her clenched and manacled hands in the officers' faces.|English
LJ014-0148|From Newgate the Mannings were taken in separate cabs to Horsemonger Lane Jail.|English
LJ014-0149|"On this journey her manner changed completely. She became flippant, joked with the officers, asked how they liked her ""resolution"" in the dock,"|English
LJ014-0150|and expressed the utmost contempt for her husband, whom she never intended to acknowledge or speak to again.|English
LJ014-0151|Later her mood changed to abject despair.|English
LJ014-0152|On reaching the condemned cell she threw herself upon the floor and shrieked in an hysterical agony of tears.|English
LJ014-0153|After this, until the day of execution, she recovered her spirits, and displayed reckless effrontery,|English
LJ014-0154|mocking at the chaplain, and turning a deaf ear to the counsels of a benevolent lady who came to visit.|English
LJ014-0155|Now she abused the jury, now called Manning a vagabond,|English
LJ014-0156|and through all ate heartily at every meal, slept soundly at nights, and talked with cheerfulness on almost any subject.|English
LJ014-0157|Nevertheless, she attempted to commit suicide by driving her nails, purposely left long, into her throat.|English
LJ014-0158|She was discovered just as she was getting black in the face.|English
LJ014-0159|Manning's demeanor was more in harmony with his situation, and the full confession he made|English
LJ014-0160|elucidated all dark and uncertain points in connection with the crime.|English
LJ014-0161|The actual execution, which took place at another prison than Newgate, is rather beyond the scope of this work.|English
LJ014-0162|But it may be mentioned that the concourse was so enormous that it drew down the well-merited and trenchant disapproval of Charles Dickens,|English
LJ014-0163|"who wrote to the 'Times,' saying that he believed ""a sight so inconceivably awful"|English
LJ014-0164|as the wickedness and levity of the immense crowd collected at the execution this morning could be imagined by no man,|English
LJ014-0165|and presented by no heathen land under the sun.|English
LJ014-0166|faded in my mind before the atrocious bearing, looks, and language of the assembled spectators.|English
LJ014-0167|When I came upon the scene at midnight, the shrillness of the cries and howls that were raised from time to time,|English
LJ014-0168|denoting that they came from a concourse of boys and girls already assembled in the best places, made my blood run cold.|English
LJ014-0169|It will be in the memory of many that Mrs. Manning appeared on the scaffold in a black satin dress, which was bound tightly round her waist.|English
LJ014-0170|This preference brought the costly stuff into disrepute, and its unpopularity lasted for nearly thirty years.|English
LJ014-0171|I will briefly describe one or two of the more remarkable murders in the years immediately following, then pass on to another branch of crime.|English
LJ014-0172|Robert Marley at the time of his arrest called himself a surgical instrument maker.|English
LJ014-0173|It was understood also that he had served in the army as a private, and had, moreover, undergone a sentence of transportation.|English
LJ014-0174|But it was supposed that he had been once in a good position, well born, and well educated.|English
LJ014-0175|When lying under sentence of death in Newgate, he was visited by a lady, a gentlewoman in every sense of the word, who was said to be his sister.|English
LJ014-0176|His determined addiction to evil courses had led to his being cast off by his family,|English
LJ014-0177|and he must have been at the end of his resources when he committed the crime for which he suffered.|English
LJ014-0178|His offense was the murder of Richard Cope,|English
LJ014-0179|a working jeweler, shopman to a Mr. Berry of Parliament Street. It was Cope's duty to stay in the shop till the last, close the shutters,|English
LJ014-0180|secure the stock of watches and jewelry, then lock up the place and take on the keys to Mr. Berry's private house in Pimlico.|English
LJ014-0181|Cope, a small man, crippled, and of weakly constitution, was alone in the shop about nine:thirty.|English
LJ014-0182|the shutters were up, and he was preparing to close, when Marley entered and fell upon him with a life-preserver,|English
LJ014-0183|meaning to kill him and rifle the shop.|English
LJ014-0184|The noise of the struggle was heard outside in the street,|English
LJ014-0185|and bystanders peeped in through the shutters, but no one entered or sought to interfere in what seemed only a domestic quarrel.|English
LJ014-0186|A milliner's porter,|English
LJ014-0187|Lerigo, was also attracted by the noise of the row, but after walking a few paces he felt dissatisfied, and returned to the spot.|English
LJ014-0188|Pushing the shop-door open, he saw Marley finishing his murderous assault.|English
LJ014-0189|Lerigo turned for assistance to take the man into custody.|English
LJ014-0190|Marley, disturbed, picked up a cigar and parcel from the counter, then ran out, pursued by Lerigo only.|English
LJ014-0191|Marley ran along the street, down into Cannon Row|English
LJ014-0192|then into Palace Yard, where the waterman of the cab-tank, in obedience to Lerigo's shouts, collared the fugitive.|English
LJ014-0193|Escorted by his two captors, Marley was taken back into Parliament Street to the jeweler's shop.|English
LJ014-0194|The policemen were now in possession;|English
LJ014-0195|two of them supported Cope, who was still alive, although insensible, and Marley was apprehended. The evidence against him was completed|English
LJ014-0196|by his identification by Cope in Westminster Hospital, who survived long enough to make a formal deposition before Mr. Jardine,|English
LJ014-0197|the police magistrate, that Marley was the man who had beaten him to death.|English
LJ014-0198|Marley at his trial was undefended, and the sheriffs offered him counsel; but he declined. The witnesses against him all spoke the truth, he said;|English
LJ014-0199|there was no case to make out; why waste money on lawyers for the defense? His demeanor was cool and collected throughout;|English
LJ014-0200|he seemed while in Newgate to realize thoroughly that there was no hope for him, and was determined to face his fate bravely.|English
LJ014-0201|After sentence, the Newgate officers who had special charge of him noticed that he slept well and ate well, enjoying all his meals.|English
LJ014-0202|One of them went into his cell just at dinner-time;|English
LJ014-0203|the great clock of St. Sepulchre's close by was striking the hour, and Marley, who had his elbows on the table,|English
LJ014-0204|"with his head resting on his hands, looked up and observed calmly, ""Go along, clock; come along, gallows."""|English
LJ014-0205|On the dread morning he came out to execution quite gaily, and tripped up the stairs to the scaffold.|English
LJ014-0206|His captors, it may be added (Lerigo and Allen), were warmly commended by the judge for their courage and activity.|English
LJ014-0207|The former was given a reward of twenty and the latter of ten pounds.|English
LJ014-0208|A murderous assault on a police constable, which so nearly ended fatally that the culprit was sentenced to death, although not executed,|English
LJ014-0209|was perpetrated in eighteen fifty-two. The case was accompanied with the most shocking brutality.|English
LJ014-0210|Cannon, by trade a chimney-sweep, had long been characterized by the bitterest hatred of the police force,|English
LJ014-0211|and had been repeatedly sentenced to imprisonment for most desperate and ferocious attacks upon various constables. His last victim was Dwyer,|English
LJ014-0212|a fine young officer who had been summoned to take Cannon into custody when the latter was drunk and riotous in front of a public-house.|English
LJ014-0213|Dwyer found Cannon bleeding profusely from a wound in the head, and persuaded him to go to a doctor's.|English
LJ014-0214|They walked together quietly for some little distance, then Cannon, without the slightest warning,|English
LJ014-0215|threw the constable on his back, and violently assaulted him by jumping on his chest and stomach,|English
LJ014-0216|and by getting his hand inside Dwyer's stock, with the idea of strangling him.|English
LJ014-0217|Dwyer managed to overpower his assailant, and got to his feet; but Cannon butted at him with his head, and again threw him to the ground,|English
LJ014-0218|after which he kicked his prostrate foe in the most brutal and cowardly manner, and until he was almost senseless, and bruised from head to foot.|English
LJ014-0219|Once more Dwyer got to his feet, and managed, by drawing his staff, to keep Cannon at bay until a second constable came to his aid.|English
LJ014-0220|All this time not one of a numerous body of bystanders offered to assist the policeman in his extremity.|English
LJ014-0221|On the contrary, many of them encouraged the brutal assailant in his savage attack.|English
LJ014-0222|To Cannon's infinite surprise, he was indicted for attempt to murder, and not for a simple assault, and found guilty.|English
LJ014-0223|The judge, in passing sentence of death, told him he richly deserved the punishment.|English
LJ014-0224|As Dwyer survived, Cannon escaped the death sentence, which was commuted to penal servitude for life.|English
LJ014-0225|A handsome sum was subscribed for the injured constable, who was disabled for life.|English
LJ014-0226|Only a few have vied with Cannon in fiendish cruelty and brutality.|English
LJ014-0227|One of these was Mobbs, who lived in the Minories,|English
LJ014-0228|"generally known by the soubriquet of ""General Haynau,"" a name execrated in England about this time."|English
LJ014-0229|Mobbs systematically ill-used his wife for a long space of time, and at last cut her throat.|English
LJ014-0230|For this he was executed in front of Newgate in eighteen thirty-three.|English
LJ014-0231|Emmanuel Barthelemy again,|English
LJ014-0232|the French refugee, was a murderer of the same description, who dispatched his victim with a loaded cane, after which, to secure his escape,|English
LJ014-0233|he shot an old soldier who had attempted to detain him. He was convicted and executed.|English
LJ014-0234|He died impenitent, declaring that he had no belief, and that it was idle to ask forgiveness of God.|English
LJ014-0235|I want forgiveness of man; I want those doors (of the prison) opened.|English
LJ014-0236|Barthelemy was generally supposed to have been a secret agent of the French police.|English
LJ014-0237|I will now pass to grave but less atrocious crimes.|English
LJ014-0238|In eighteen fifty occurred the first of a series of gigantic frauds,|English
LJ014-0239|which followed each other at no long intervals, which had a strong family likeness, and originated all of them to make money easily,|English
LJ014-0240|without capital, and at railroad speed.|English
LJ014-0241|Walter Watts was an inventor, a creator, who struck an entirely new and original line of crime.|English
LJ014-0242|Employed as a clerk in the Globe Assurance,|English
LJ014-0243|he with unusual quickness of apprehension discovered and promptly turned to account an inexcusably lax system of management,|English
LJ014-0244|which offered peculiar chances of profit to an ingenious and unscrupulous man.|English
LJ014-0245|It was the custom in this office to make the banker's passbook the basis of the entries in the company's ledgers.|English
LJ014-0246|Thus, when a payment was made by the company, the amount disbursed was carried to account in the general books from its entry in the passbook,|English
LJ014-0247|and without reference to or comparison with the documents in which the payment was claimed.|English
LJ014-0248|This passbook, when not at the bank, was in the exclusive custody of Watts.|English
LJ014-0249|The cheques drawn by the directors also passed through his hands; to him too they came back to be verified and put by,|English
LJ014-0250|after they had been cashed by the bank.|English
LJ014-0251|In this way Watts had complete control over the whole of the monetary transactions of the company.|English
LJ014-0252|He could do what he liked with the passbook, and by its adoption, as described as the basis of all entries,|English
LJ014-0253|there was no independent check upon him if he chose to tamper with it.|English
LJ014-0254|This he did to an enormous extent,|English
LJ014-0255|continually altering, erasing, and adding figures to correspond with and cover the abstractions he made of various cheques as they were drawn.|English
LJ014-0256|It seems incredible that this passbook, which when produced in court|English
LJ014-0257|was a mass of blots and erasures, should not have created suspicion of foul play either at the bank or at the company's board.|English
LJ014-0258|Implicit confidence appears to have been placed in Watts, who was the son of an old and trusted employee, and, moreover, a young man of plausible address.|English
LJ014-0259|Watts led two lives.|English
LJ014-0260|In the West End he was a man of fashion, with a town house, a house at Brighton, and a cellar full of good wine at both.|English
LJ014-0261|He rode a priceless hack in Rotten Row, or drove down to Richmond in a mail phaeton and pair.|English
LJ014-0262|He played high, and spent his nights at the club, or in joyous and dissolute company.|English
LJ014-0263|When other pleasures palled he took a theatre, and posed as a munificent patron of the dramatic art.|English
LJ014-0264|"Under his auspices several ""stars"" appeared on the boards of the Marylebone theatre,"|English
LJ014-0265|and later he became manager of the newly rebuilt Olympic at Wych Street.|English
LJ014-0266|No one cared too closely to inquire into the sources of wealth. Some said he was a fortunate speculator in stocks,|English
LJ014-0267|others that he had had extraordinary luck as a gold-digger. Had his West End and little-informed associates followed him into the city,|English
LJ014-0268|whither he was taken every morning in a smart brougham, they would have seen him alight from it in Cornhill,|English
LJ014-0269|and walk forward on foot to enter as a humble and unpretending employee the doors of the Globe Assurance office.|English
LJ014-0271|Nevertheless, in this position, through the culpable carelessness which left him unfettered, he managed between eighteen forty-four|English
LJ014-0272|and eighteen fifty to embezzle and apply to his own purposes some seventy-one thousand pounds.|English
LJ014-0273|The detection of these frauds came while he was still prominently before the world as the lessee of the Olympic.|English
LJ014-0274|Rumors were abroad that serious defalcations had been discovered in one of the insurance offices,|English
LJ014-0275|but it was long before the public realized that the fraudulent clerk and the great theatrical manager were one and the same person.|English
LJ014-0276|Watts's crime was discovered by the secretary of the Globe Company, who came suddenly upon the extensive falsification of the passbook.|English
LJ014-0277|An inquiry was at once set on foot, and the frauds were traced to Watts.|English
LJ014-0278|The latter, when first taxed with his offense, protested his innocence boldly, and positively denied all knowledge of the affair;|English
LJ014-0279|and he had so cleverly destroyed all traces that it was not easy to bring home the charge.|English
LJ014-0280|But it was proved that Watts had appropriated one cheque for fourteen hundred pounds,|English
LJ014-0281|which he had paid into his own bankers, and on this he was committed to Newgate for trial.|English
LJ014-0282|There were two counts in the indictment: one for stealing a cheque value fourteen hundred pounds, the second for stealing a bit of paper value one penny.|English
LJ014-0283|The jury found him guilty of the latter only, with a point of law reserved. This was fully argued before three judges,|English
LJ014-0285|and not for the slight offense as it appeared on the record.|English
LJ014-0286|The sentence of the court, one of ten years' transportation, struck the prisoner with dismay.|English
LJ014-0287|He had been led to suppose that twelve months' imprisonment was the utmost the law could inflict, and he broke down utterly under the unexpected blow.|English
LJ014-0288|That same evening he committed suicide in Newgate.|English
LJ014-0289|The details of the suicide were given at the inquest. Watts had been in ill-health from the time of his first arrest.|English
LJ014-0290|In Giltspur Street Compter, where he was first lodged|English
LJ014-0291|he showed symptoms of delirium tremens, and admitted that he had been addicted to the excessive use of stimulants.|English
LJ014-0292|His health improved, but was still indifferent when he was brought up for sentence, and he was an occupant of the Newgate infirmary.|English
LJ014-0293|He returned from court in a state of gloomy dejection,|English
LJ014-0294|and in the middle of the night one of the fellow-prisoners who slept in the same ward noticed that he was not in his bed.|English
LJ014-0295|This man got up to look for him, and found him hanging from the bars of a neighboring room.|English
LJ014-0296|He had made use of a piece of rope cut out from the sacking of his bedstead, and had tied his feet together with a silk pocket-handkerchief.|English
LJ014-0297|The prison officers were called, but Watts was quite cold and stiff when he was cut down.|English
LJ014-0298|Strange to say, a second suicide occurred in Newgate the same night,|English
LJ014-0299|that of a prize-fighter named Donovan, tried the same day, and convicted of manslaughter.|English
LJ014-0300|Sentence of death had been recorded against Donovan, who, like Watts, had seemingly been overcome with sudden despair.|English
LJ014-0301|In eighteen fifty-three a second case of gigantic fraud alarmed and scandalized the financial world.|English
LJ014-0302|It outshone the defalcations of Watts.|English
LJ014-0303|Nothing to equal the excitement caused by the forgeries of Robert Ferdinand Pries had been known before in the city of London.|English
LJ014-0304|He was a corn merchant who operated largely in grain.|English
LJ014-0305|So enormous were his transactions, that they often affected the markets, and caused great fluctuations in prices.|English
LJ014-0306|These had been attributed to political action; some thought that the large purchases in foreign grains, effected at losing prices,|English
LJ014-0307|were intended by the protectionists to depress the wheat market, and secure the support of the farmers at the forthcoming election;|English
LJ014-0308|others, that Napoleon the third, but recently proclaimed Emperor of the French, wished to gain the popularity necessary to secure the people.|English
LJ014-0309|"Few realized that these mysterious operations were the ""convulsive attempt"" of a ruined and dishonest speculator to sustain his credit."|English
LJ014-0310|Pries, although enjoying a high reputation in the city, had long been in a bad way.|English
LJ014-0311|His extensive business had been carried on by fraud.|English
LJ014-0312|His method was to obtain advances twice over on the same bills of lading or corn warrants. The duplicates were forged.|English
LJ014-0313|In this way he obtained vast sums from several firms, and one to which he was indebted upwards of fifty thousand pounds subsequently stopped payment.|English
LJ014-0314|Pries at length was discovered|English
LJ014-0315|through a dishonored cheque for three thousand pounds, paid over as an installment of eighteen thousand pounds owing for an advance on warrants.|English
LJ014-0316|Inquiries were instituted when the cheque was protested, which led to the discovery of the forgeries.|English
LJ014-0317|Pries was lodged in Newgate, tried at the Old Bailey, and transported for life.|English
LJ014-0318|Another set of frauds, which resembled those of Pries in principle, although not in practice, were soon afterwards discovered.|English
LJ014-0320|proposed to gain the capital he needed for business purposes by raising money on dock warrants for imported goods which had no real existence.|English
LJ014-0321|When such goods arrived they were frequently left at a wharf, paying rent until it suited the importer to remove them.|English
LJ014-0322|The dock warrant was issued by the wharfinger as certificate that he held the goods.|English
LJ014-0323|The warrant thus represented money, and was often used as such, being endorsed and passed from hand to hand as other negotiable bills.|English
LJ014-0324|Cole's plan was to have a wharf of his own, nominally occupied by a creature trading as Maltby and Co.|English
LJ014-0325|Goods would be landed at this wharf;|English
LJ014-0326|Maltby and Co. would issue warrants on them deliverable to the importer, and the goods were then passed to be stored in neighboring warehouses.|English
LJ014-0327|The owners of the latter would then issue a second set of warrants on these goods, in total ignorance of the fact that they were already pledged.|English
LJ014-0328|Cole quickly raised money on both sets of warrants. He carried on this game for some time with great success,|English
LJ014-0329|and so developed his business that in one year his transactions amounted to a couple of millions of pounds.|English
LJ014-0330|He had several narrow escapes.|English
LJ014-0331|"Once a warrant-holder sent down a clerk to view certain goods, and the clerk found that these goods had already a ""stop"" upon them, or were pledged."|English
LJ014-0332|"Cole escaped by throwing the blame on a careless partner, and at once removed the ""stop."""|English
LJ014-0333|Again, some of the duplicate and fictitious warrants were held by a firm which suspended payment, and there was no knowing into whose hands they might fall.|English
LJ014-0334|Cole found out where they were, and redeemed them at a heavy outlay, thus obtaining business relations with the firm that held them,|English
LJ014-0335|which were soon developed, much to that firm's subsequent anger and regret.|English
LJ014-0336|Last of all, the well-known bankers Overend and Gurney, whose own affairs created much excitement some years later,|English
LJ014-0337|wishing to verify the value of warrants they held, and sending to Maltby and Co.'s wharf, found out half the truth.|English
LJ014-0338|These bankers, wishing for more specific information,|English
LJ014-0339|asked Davidson and Gordon, a firm with which Cole was closely allied, whether the warrants meant goods or nothing.|English
LJ014-0340|They could not deny that the latter was the truth, and were forthwith stigmatized by Mr. Chapman, Overend and Gurney's representative, as rogues.|English
LJ015-0001|Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section eighteen: Newgate notorieties continued, part three.|English
LJ015-0002|The course of the swindlers was by no means smooth, but it was not till eighteen fifty-four that suspicion arose that anything was wrong.|English
LJ015-0003|A firm which held a lot of warrants suddenly demanded the delivery of the goods they covered.|English
LJ015-0004|The goods having no existence, Cole of course could not deliver them.|English
LJ015-0005|About this time Davidson and Gordon, the people above-mentioned,|English
LJ015-0006|who had fraudulent warrants out of their own to the extent of one hundred fifty thousand pounds, suspended payment and absconded.|English
LJ015-0007|This affected Cole's credit, and ugly reports were in circulation charging him with the issue of simulated warrants.|English
LJ015-0008|These indeed were out to the value of three hundred sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred pounds.|English
LJ015-0009|Cole's difficulties increased more and more; warrant-holders came down upon him demanding to realize their goods.|English
LJ015-0010|Cole now suspended payment.|English
LJ015-0011|Maltby, who had bolted, was pursued and arrested, to end his life miserably by committing suicide in a Newgate cell.|English
LJ015-0012|Cole too was apprehended, and in due course tried at the Central Criminal Court.|English
LJ015-0013|He was found guilty, and sentenced to the seemingly inadequate punishment of four years' transportation.|English
LJ015-0014|Davidson and Gordon were also sentenced to imprisonment.|English
LJ015-0015|A more distressing case stands next on the criminal records --|English
LJ015-0016|the failure and subsequent sentence of the bankers Messrs. Strahan, Paul, and Bates,|English
LJ015-0017|for the fraudulent disposal of securities lodged in their hands. This firm was one of the oldest banking establishments in the kingdom,|English
LJ015-0018|and dated back to the Commonwealth, when, under the title of Snow and Walton, it carried on business as pawnbrokers.|English
LJ015-0019|The Strahan of the firm which came to grief was a Snow who changed his name for a fortune of two hundred thousand pounds;|English
LJ015-0020|he was a man esteemed and respected in society and the world of finance, incapable as it was thought of a dishonest deed.|English
LJ015-0021|Sir John Dean Paul had inherited a baronetcy from his father, together with an honored name;|English
LJ015-0022|he was himself a prominent member of the Low Church, of austere piety, active in all good works.|English
LJ015-0023|Mr. Bates had been confidential managing clerk, and was taken into the firm not alone as a reward for long and faithful service|English
LJ015-0024|but that he might strengthen it by his long experience and known business capacity.|English
LJ015-0025|The bank enjoyed an excellent reputation, it had a good connection, and was supposed to be perfectly sound.|English
LJ015-0026|Moreover, the partners were sober, steady men, who paid unremitting attention to business.|English
LJ015-0027|Yet even so early as the death of the first Sir John Paul,|English
LJ015-0028|the bank was insolvent, and instead of starting on a fresh life with a new name, it should then and there have closed its doors.|English
LJ015-0029|In December eighteen fifty-one the balance sheet showed a deficiency of upwards of seventy thousand pounds.|English
LJ015-0030|The bank had been conducted on false principles;|English
LJ015-0031|it had assumed enormous responsibilities -- on one side by the ownership of the Mostyn collieries, a valueless property,|English
LJ015-0032|and on the other by backing up|English
LJ015-0033|an impecunious and rotten firm of contractors with vast liabilities and pledged to impossible works abroad.|English
LJ015-0034|The engagements of the bank on these two heads amounting to nearly half a million of money,|English
LJ015-0035|produced immediate embarrassment and financial distress.|English
LJ015-0036|The bank was already insolvent,|English
LJ015-0037|and the partners had to decide between suspending payment or continuing to hold its head above water by flagitious processes.|English
LJ015-0038|They chose, unhappily for themselves, the latter alternative.|English
LJ015-0039|Money they must have, and money they raised to meet their urgent necessities upon the balances and securities deposited with them by their customers.|English
LJ015-0040|This borrowing continued, and on such a scale that their paper was soon at a discount,|English
LJ015-0041|and the various discount houses would not advance sufficient sums to relieve the necessities of the bank.|English
LJ015-0042|Then it was that instead of merely pledging securities, the bank sold them outright, and thus passed the Rubicon of fraud.|English
LJ015-0043|This went on for some time, and might never have been discovered had some good stroke of luck provided any of the partners|English
LJ015-0044|with money enough to retrieve the position of the bank. But that passed from bad to worse;|English
LJ015-0045|the firm's paper went down further and further in value; an application to the Committee of Bankers for assistance was peremptorily refused,|English
LJ015-0046|then came a run on the bank, and it was compelled to stop payment.|English
LJ015-0047|Its debts amounted to three-quarters of a million, and the dividend it eventually paid was three and twopence in the pound.|English
LJ015-0048|But worse than the bankruptcy was the confession made by the partners in the court.|English
LJ015-0049|They admitted that they had made away with many of the securities entrusted to their keeping.|English
LJ015-0050|Following this, warrants were issued for their arrest,|English
LJ015-0051|the specific charge being the unlawful negotiation of Danish bonds and other shares belonging to the Rev. Dr. Griffiths of Rochester|English
LJ015-0052|to the value of twenty thousand pounds.|English
LJ015-0053|Bates was at once captured in Norfolk Street, Strand.|English
LJ015-0054|Police officers went down at night to Nutfield, near Reigate, and arrested Sir John Paul, but allowed the prisoner to sleep there.|English
LJ015-0055|Next morning they only just saved the train to town, and left Sir John behind on the platform, but he subsequently surrendered himself.|English
LJ015-0056|Mr. Strahan was arrested at a friend's house in Bryanston Square.|English
LJ015-0057|All three were tried at the Central Criminal Court, and sentenced to fourteen years' transportation, passing some time in Newgate en route.|English
LJ015-0058|Bates, the least guilty, was pardoned in eighteen fifty-eight.|English
LJ015-0059|Two cases of extensive embezzlement which were discovered almost simultaneously, those of Robson and Redpath,|English
LJ015-0060|will long be remembered both within and without the commercial world.|English
LJ015-0061|They both reproduced many of the features of the case of Watts, already described,|English
LJ015-0062|but in neither did the sums misappropriated reach quite the same high figure.|English
LJ015-0063|But neither Robson nor Redpath would have been able to pursue their fraudulent designs with success had they not, like Watts,|English
LJ015-0064|been afforded peculiar facilities by the slackness of system and the want of methodical administration in the concerns by which they were employed.|English
LJ015-0065|Robson was of humble origin, but he was well educated, and he had some literary abilities.|English
LJ015-0066|His proclivities were theatrical, and he was the author of several plays,|English
LJ015-0067|one at least of which, 'Love and Loyalty,' with Wallack in a leading part, achieved a certain success.|English
LJ015-0068|He began life as a law-writer, earning thereby some fifteen or eighteen shillings a week;|English
LJ015-0069|but the firm he served got him a situation as clerk in the office of the Great Northern Railway,|English
LJ015-0070|whence he passed to a better position under the Crystal Palace Company.|English
LJ015-0071|He now married, although his salary was only a pound a week; but he soon got on.|English
LJ015-0072|He had a pleasant address, showed good business aptitudes, and quickly acquired the approval of his superiors.|English
LJ015-0073|Within a year he was advanced to the post of chief clerk in the transfer department, at a salary of one hundred fifty pounds a year.|English
LJ015-0074|His immediate chief was a Mr. Fasson, upon whose confidence he gained so rapidly, through his activity, industry, and engaging manners,|English
LJ015-0075|that ere long the whole management of the transfer department was entrusted to him.|English
LJ015-0076|Some time elapsed before Robson succumbed to temptation.|English
LJ015-0077|He was not the first man of loose morality and expensive tastes|English
LJ015-0078|who preferred to risk his future reputation and liberty to the present discomfort of living upon narrow means.|English
LJ015-0079|The temptation was all the greater because the chances of successful fraud lay ready to hand.|English
LJ015-0080|Shares in the company were represented by certificates, which often enough never left the company's, or more exactly Robson's, hands.|English
LJ015-0081|He conceived the idea of transferring shares, bogus shares from a person who held none, to any one who would buy them in the open market.|English
LJ015-0082|He took it for granted that the certificates representing these bogus shares, and which practically did not exist, would never be called for.|English
LJ015-0083|This ingenious method of raising funds he adopted and carried on without detection,|English
LJ015-0084|till the defalcations from fraudulent transfers and fraudulent issues combined amounted to twenty-seven thousand pounds.|English
LJ015-0085|With the proceeds of these flagitious frauds Robson feasted and made merry.|English
LJ015-0086|He kept open house at Kilburn Priory;|English
LJ015-0087|"entertained literary, artistic, and dramatic celebrities; had a smart ""turn out,"" attended all the race-meetings, and dressed in the latest fashion."|English
LJ015-0088|To his wife, poor soul, he made no pretense of fidelity, and she enjoyed only so much of his company as was necessarily spent|English
LJ015-0089|in receiving guests at home, or could be spared from two rival establishments in other parts of the town.|English
LJ015-0090|To account for his revenues he pretended to have been very lucky on the Stock Exchange, which was at one time true to a limited extent,|English
LJ015-0091|and to have succeeded in other speculations.|English
LJ015-0092|When his friends asked why he, a wealthy man of independent means, continued to slave on as a clerk on a pittance,|English
LJ015-0093|he replied gaily that his regular work at the Crystal Palace office was useful as a sort of discipline, and kept him steady.|English
LJ015-0094|All this time his position was one of extreme insecurity. He was standing over a mine which at any moment might explode.|English
LJ015-0095|The blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. One morning Mr. Fasson asked casually for certain certificates,|English
LJ015-0096|whether representing real or fictitious shares does not appear; but they were certificates connected in some way with Robson's long practiced frauds|English
LJ015-0097|and he could not produce them. His chief asked sternly where they were.|English
LJ015-0098|Robson said they were at Kilburn Priory.|English
LJ015-0099|Let us go to Kilburn for them together, said Mr. Fasson, growing suspicious.|English
LJ015-0100|They drove there, and Robson on arrival did the honors of his house, rang for lunch to gain time,|English
LJ015-0101|but at Mr. Fasson's pressing demands went upstairs to fetch the certificates.|English
LJ015-0102|He came back to explain that he had mislaid them.|English
LJ015-0103|Mr. Fasson, more and more ill at ease, would not accept this subterfuge, and declared they must be found.|English
LJ015-0104|Robson again left him, but only to gather together hastily all the money and valuables on which he could lay his hands, with which he left the house.|English
LJ015-0105|Mr. Fasson waited and waited for his subordinate to re-appear, and at last discovered his flight.|English
LJ015-0106|A reward was forthwith offered for Robson's apprehension.|English
LJ015-0107|Meanwhile the absconding clerk had coolly driven to a favorite dining-place in the West End,|English
LJ015-0108|where a fish curry and a brace of partridges were set before him,|English
LJ015-0109|and he discussed the latter with appetite, but begged that they would never give him curry again, as he did not like it.|English
LJ015-0110|After dinner he went into hiding for a day or two,|English
LJ015-0111|then, accompanied by a lady, not Mrs. Robson, he took steamer and started for Copenhagen.|English
LJ015-0112|But the continental police had been warned to look out for him, and two Danish inspectors got upon his track,|English
LJ015-0113|followed him over to Sweden, and arrested him at Helsingfors.|English
LJ015-0114|Thence he was transferred to Copenhagen and surrendered in due course to a London police officer.|English
LJ015-0115|Little more remains to be said about Robson. He appears to have accepted his position, and to have at once resigned himself to his fate.|English
LJ015-0116|"When brought to trial he took matters very coolly, and at first pleaded ""Not Guilty,"" but subsequently withdrew the plea."|English
LJ015-0117|Sergeant Ballantine, who prosecuted,|English
LJ015-0118|"paid him the compliment of describing him as ""a young man of great intelligence, considerable powers of mind,"|English
LJ015-0119|"and possessed of an education very much beyond the rank of life to which he originally belonged."""|English
LJ015-0120|Robson was found guilty, and sentenced to two terms of transportation, one for twenty and one for fourteen years.|English
LJ015-0121|Newgate officers who remember Robson still describe him as a fine young man, who behaved well as a prisoner,|English
LJ015-0122|but who had all the appearance of a careless, thoughtless, happy-go-lucky fellow.|English
LJ015-0123|In many respects the embezzlement of which Leopold Redpath was guilty closely resembled that of Robson,|English
LJ015-0124|but it was based upon more extended and audacious forgeries.|English
LJ015-0125|Redpath's crime arose from his peculiar and independent position as registrar of stock of the Great Northern Railway Company.|English
LJ015-0126|This offered him great facilities for the creation of artificial stock, its sale from a fictitious holder, and transfer to himself.|English
LJ015-0127|"All the signatures in the transfer were forged. Not only did he thus transfer and realize ""bogus"" stock"|English
LJ015-0128|but he bought bona fide amounts, and increased their value by altering the figures,|English
LJ015-0129|by inserting say one before five hundred, and thus making it|English
LJ015-0130|fifteen hundred pounds, which larger amount was duly carried to his credit on the register, and entered upon the certificates of transfer.|English
LJ015-0131|By these means Redpath misappropriated vast sums during a period extending over ten years.|English
LJ015-0132|The total amount was never exactly made out, but the false stock created and issued by him was estimated at two hundred twenty thousand pounds.|English
LJ015-0133|Even when the bubble burst Redpath, who had lived at the rate of twenty thousand a year,|English
LJ015-0134|had assets in the shape of land, house, furniture, pictures, and objets d'art to the value of fifty thousand pounds.|English
LJ015-0135|He began in a very small way.|English
LJ015-0136|First a lawyer's clerk, he then got an appointment in the Peninsular and Oriental Company's office;|English
LJ015-0137|afterwards he set up as an insurance broker on his own account, but presently failed.|English
LJ015-0138|His fault was generosity,|English
LJ015-0139|an open-handed, unthinking charity which gave freely to the poor and needy the money which belonged to his creditors.|English
LJ015-0140|After his bankruptcy he obtained a place as clerk in the Great Northern Railway office,|English
LJ015-0141|from which he rose to be assistant registrar, with the special duties of transferring shares.|English
LJ015-0142|He soon proved his ability, and by unremitting attention mastered the whole work of the office.|English
LJ015-0143|Later on he became registrar, and in this more independent position|English
LJ015-0144|developed to a colossal extent the frauds he had already practiced as a subordinate.|English
LJ015-0145|Now he launched out into great expenditure, took a house in Chester Terrace, and became known as a Maecenas and patron of the arts.|English
LJ015-0146|He had a nice taste in bric-à-brac, and was considered a good judge of pictures.|English
LJ015-0147|Leading social and artistic personages were to be met with at his house, and his hospitality was far famed.|English
LJ015-0148|The choicest wines, the finest fruits,|English
LJ015-0149|peas at ten shillings a quart, five-guinea pines, and early asparagus were to be found on his table.|English
LJ015-0150|But his chief extravagance, his favorite folly, was the exercise of an ostentatious benevolence.|English
LJ015-0151|The philanthropy he had displayed in a small way when less prosperous became now a passion.|English
LJ015-0152|His name headed every subscription list; his purse was always open.|English
LJ015-0153|Not content with giving where assistance was solicited, he himself sought out deserving cases and personally afforded relief.|English
LJ015-0154|When the crash came there were pensioners and other recipients of his bounty who could not believe|English
LJ015-0155|that so good a man had really been for years a swindler and a rogue.|English
LJ015-0156|Down at Weybridge, where he had a country place, his name was long remembered with gratitude by the poor.|English
LJ015-0157|During the days of his prosperity he was a governor of Christ's Hospital,|English
LJ015-0158|of the St. Ann's Society, and one of the supporters and managers of the Patriotic Fund.|English
LJ015-0159|In his person he was neat and fastidious;|English
LJ015-0160|he patronized the best tailors, and had a fashionable coiffeur from Hanover Square daily to curl his hair.|English
LJ015-0161|There was something dramatic in Redpath's detection|English
LJ015-0162|Just after Robson's frauds had agitated the minds of all directors of companies, the chairman of the Great Northern (Mr. Denison)|English
LJ015-0163|was standing at a railway station talking to a certain well-known peer of the realm.|English
LJ015-0164|Redpath passed and lifted his hat to his chairman; the latter acknowledged the salute.|English
LJ015-0165|But the peer rushed forward and shook Redpath warmly by the hand.|English
LJ015-0166|"What do you know of our clerk? asked Mr. Denison of his lordship. ""Only that he is a capital fellow, who gives the best dinners and balls in town."""|English
LJ015-0167|Redpath had industriously circulated reports that he had prospered greatly in speculation;|English
LJ015-0168|but the chairman of the Great Northern could not realize that a clerk of the company could honestly be in the possession of unlimited wealth.|English
LJ015-0169|It was at once decided at the board to make a thorough examination of all his books.|English
LJ015-0170|Redpath was called in and informed of the intended investigation. He tried to stave off the evil hour by declaring that everything was perfectly right;|English
LJ015-0171|but finding he could not escape, he said he would resign his post, and leaving the boardroom, disappeared.|English
LJ015-0172|The inquiry soon revealed the colossal character of the frauds.|English
LJ015-0173|Warrants were issued for Redpath's arrest, but he had flown to Paris.|English
LJ015-0174|Thither police officers followed, only to find that he had returned to London.|English
LJ015-0175|A further search discovered him at breakfast at a small house in the New Road.|English
LJ015-0176|He was arrested, examined before a police magistrate, and committed to Newgate.|English
LJ015-0177|Great excitement prevailed in the city and the West End when Redpath's defalcations were made public.|English
LJ015-0178|The Stock Market was greatly affected, and society, more especially that which frequents Exeter Hall, was convulsed.|English
LJ015-0179|The Central Criminal Court, when the trial came on,|English
LJ015-0180|was densely crowded, and many curious eyes were turned upon the somewhat remarkable man who occupied the dock.|English
LJ015-0181|He is described by a contemporary account as a fresh-looking man of forty years of age, slightly bald, inclined to embonpoint,|English
LJ015-0182|and thoroughly embodying the idea of English respectability.|English
LJ015-0183|"His manner was generally self-possessed, but his face was marked with ""uneasy earnestness,"""|English
LJ015-0184|and he looked about him with wayward, furtive glances.|English
LJ015-0185|When the jury found a verdict of guilty he remained unmoved. He listened without emotion to the judge's well-merited censures,|English
LJ015-0186|and received his sentence of transportation for life without much surprise.|English
LJ015-0187|Redpath passed away into the outer darkness of a penal colony, where he was still living a year or two back|English
LJ015-0188|But his name lingers still in this country as that of the first swindler of his time,|English
LJ015-0189|and the prototype of a class not uncommon in our later days|English
LJ015-0190|that of dishonest rogues who assume piety and philanthropy as a cloak for their misdeeds.|English
LJ015-0191|In Newgate Redpath is remembered by the prison officer as a difficult man to deal with.|English
LJ015-0192|From the moment of his reception he gave himself great airs, as a martyr and a man heavily wronged.|English
LJ015-0193|By-and-by, when escape seemed hopeless, and after sentence, he suddenly degenerated into the lowest stamp of criminal,|English
LJ015-0194|and behaved so as to justify a belief that he had been a jail-bird all his life.|English
LJ015-0195|It has been already remarked in these pages that with changed social conditions came a great change in the character of crimes.|English
LJ015-0196|"Highway robberies, for instance, had disappeared, if we except the spasmodic and severely repressed outbreak of ""garotting,"""|English
LJ015-0197|which at one time spread terror throughout London. Thieves preferred now to use ingenuity rather than brute force.|English
LJ015-0198|It was no longer possible to stop a coach or carriage, or rob the postman who carried the mail.|English
LJ015-0199|The improved methods of locomotion had put a stop to these depredations. People traveled in company, as a rule;|English
LJ015-0200|only when single and unprotected were they in any danger of attack, and that but rarely.|English
LJ015-0201|There were still big prizes, however, to tempt the daring, and none appealed more to the thievish instinct than the custom of transmitting gold by rail.|English
LJ015-0202|The precious metal was sent from place to place carefully locked up and guarded, no doubt;|English
LJ015-0203|but were the precautions too minute, the vigilance too close to be eluded or overcome?|English
LJ015-0204|This was the question which presented itself to the fertile brain of one Pierce,|English
LJ015-0205|"who had been concerned in various ""jobs"" of a dishonest character, and who for the moment was a clerk in a betting office."|English
LJ015-0206|He laid the suggestion before Agar, a professional thief, who was of opinion it contained elements of success.|English
LJ015-0207|But the collusion and active assistance of employees of the railway carriers were indispensable, and together|English
LJ015-0208|they sounded one Burgess, a guard on the South-Eastern Railway, a line by which large quantities of bullion were sent to the Continent.|English
LJ015-0209|Burgess detailed the whole system of transmission.|English
LJ015-0210|The gold, packed in an iron-bound box, was securely lodged in safes locked with patent Chubbs.|English
LJ015-0211|Each safe had three sets of double keys, all held by confidential servants of the company.|English
LJ015-0212|One pair was with the traffic superintendent in London, another with an official in Folkestone,|English
LJ015-0213|a third with the captain of the Folkestone and Boulogne boat.|English
LJ015-0214|At the other side of the Channel the French railway authorities took charge.|English
LJ015-0215|The safes while on the line en route between London and Folkestone were in the guard's van.|English
LJ015-0216|This was an important step, and they might easily be robbed some day when Burgess was the guard, provided only that they could be opened.|English
LJ015-0217|The next step was to get impressions and fabricate false keys.|English
LJ015-0218|A new accomplice was now needed within the company's establishment, and Pierce looked about long before he found the right person.|English
LJ015-0219|At last he decided to enlist one Tester, a clerk in the traffic department, whom he thought would prove a likely tool.|English
LJ015-0220|The four waited patiently for their opportunity,|English
LJ015-0221|which came when the safes were sent to Chubbs' to be repaired; and Chubbs sent them back, but only with one key,|English
LJ015-0222|in such a way that Tester had possession of this key for a time.|English
LJ015-0223|He lent it to Agar for a brief space, who promptly took an impression on wax. But the safes had a double lock;|English
LJ015-0224|the difficulty was to get a copy of the second key.|English
LJ015-0225|This was at length effected by Agar and Pierce.|English
LJ015-0226|After hanging about the Folkestone office for some time, they saw at last that the key was kept in a certain cupboard.|English
LJ015-0227|Still watching and waiting for the first chance, they seized it when the clerks left the office empty for a moment.|English
LJ015-0228|Pierce boldly stepped in, found the cupboard unlocked; he removed the key, handed it to Agar outside,|English
LJ015-0229|who quickly took the wax impression, handed it back to Pierce; Pierce replaced it, left the office, and the thing was done.|English
LJ015-0230|After this nothing remained but to wait for some occasion when the amount transmitted would be sufficient to justify the risks of robbery.|English
LJ015-0231|It was Tester's business, who had access to the railway company's books, to watch for this.|English
LJ015-0232|Meanwhile the others completed their preparations with the utmost care.|English
LJ015-0233|A weight of shot was bought and stowed in carpet bags ready to replace exactly the abstracted gold.|English
LJ015-0234|"Courier bags were bought to carry the ""stuff"" slung over the shoulders;"|English
LJ015-0235|and last, but not least, Agar frequently traveled up and down the line to test the false keys he had manufactured with Pierce's assistance.|English
LJ015-0236|Burgess admitted him into the guard's van, where he fitted and filed the keys till they worked easily and satisfactorily in the locks of the safe.|English
LJ015-0237|"One night Tester whispered to Agar and Pierce, ""All right,"" as they cautiously lounged about London Bridge."|English
LJ015-0238|The thieves took first-class tickets, handed their bags full of shot to the porters, who placed them in the guard's van.|English
LJ015-0239|Just as the train was starting Agar slipped into the van with Burgess, and Pierce got into a first-class carriage.|English
LJ015-0240|Agar at once got to work on the first safe.|English
LJ015-0241|opened it, took out and broke into the bullion box, removed the gold, substituted the shot from a carpet bag,|English
LJ015-0242|re-fastened and re-sealed the bullion box, and replaced it in the safe.|English
